INT. ATHENS - ROYAL PALACE - DAY

Enter THESEUS, HIPPOLYTA, PHILOSTRATE, and Attendants

THESEUS
Now, fair Hippolyta, our nuptial hour
Draws on apace; four happy days bring in Another moon: but, O, methinks, how slow This old moon wanes! she lingers my desires, Like to a step-dame or a dowager
Long withering out a young man revenue.

THESEUS ^
The clock's ticking, Hippolyta. Our wedding's coming up fast. But man, time's dragging. It's like waiting for an inheritance that's taking forever to come through.

HIPPOLYTA
Four days will quickly steep themselves in night;
Four nights will quickly dream away the time; And then the moon, like to a silver bow New-bent in heaven, shall behold the night
Of our solemnities.

HIPPOLYTA ^
Four days and nights will fly by, and then the new moon will light up our big night.

THESEUS
Go, Philostrate,
Stir up the Athenian youth to merriments; Awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth; Turn melancholy forth to funerals;
The pale companion is not for our pomp.

THESEUS ^
Philostrate, go get the young people of Athens excited. We need energy and fun, not gloom and doom. Save the sadness for funerals; it has no place here.

INT. ATHENS - ROYAL PALACE - DAY - CONTINUOUS

Exit Philostrate.

Enter Egeus, Hermia, Lysander and Demetrius.

THESEUS
Hippolyta, I woo'd thee with my sword, And won thy love, doing thee injuries;
But I will wed thee in another key,
With pomp, with triumph and with revelling.

THESEUS ^
Hippolyta, I won you over through conquest, but our wedding will be a different story — full of celebration and joy.

EGEUS
Happy be Theseus, our renowned duke!

EGEUS ^
Good to see you, Theseus, our respected leader!

THESEUS
Thanks, good Egeus: what's the news with thee?

THESEUS ^
Thanks, Egeus. What brings you here?

EGEUS
Full of vexation come I, with complaint
Against my child, my daughter Hermia.
Stand forth, Demetrius. My noble lord,
This man hath my consent to marry her.
Stand forth, Lysander: and my gracious duke,
This man hath bewitch'd the bosom of my child;
Thou, thou, Lysander, thou hast given her rhymes,
And interchanged love-tokens with my child:
Thou hast by moonlight at her window sung,
With feigning voice verses of feigning love,
And stolen the impression of her fantasy
With bracelets of thy hair, rings, gawds, conceits,
Knacks, trifles, nosegays, sweetmeats, messengers
Of strong prevailment in unharden'd youth:
With cunning hast thou filch'd my daughter's heart,
Turn'd her obedience, which is due to me,
To stubborn harshness: and, my gracious duke,
Be it so she; will not here before your grace
Consent to marry with Demetrius,
I beg the ancient privilege of Athens,
As she is mine, I may dispose of her:
Which shall be either to this gentleman
Or to her death, according to our law
Immediately provided in that case.

EGEUS ^
I'm here, frustrated and complaining about my daughter, Hermia. Demetrius, step forward. I've given him my blessing to marry her. And Lysander, you too. You've enchanted my daughter, given her poems, exchanged love tokens, and even serenaded her. You've stolen her heart and turned her against me. If she doesn't agree to marry Demetrius, according to Athenian law, I can either give her to him or she faces death.

THESEUS
What say you, Hermia? be advised fair maid:
To you your father should be as a god;
One that composed your beauties, yea, and one
To whom you are but as a form in wax
By him imprinted and within his power
To leave the figure or disfigure it.
Demetrius is a worthy gentleman.

THESEUS ^
Hermia, think carefully. Your father should be like a god to you. He made you, and you're like clay in his hands. He can shape or reshape you. Demetrius is a good catch.

HERMIA
So is Lysander.

HERMIA ^
Lysander is a good catch too.

THESEUS
In himself he is;
But in this kind, wanting your father's voice,
The other must be held the worthier.

THESEUS ^
He might be, but without your father's approval, Demetrius is the better option.

HERMIA
I would my father look'd but with my eyes.

HERMIA ^
I wish my father could see things my way.

THESEUS
Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.

THESEUS ^
You should see things through your father's eyes, not your own.

HERMIA
I do entreat your grace to pardon me.
I know not by what power I am made bold,
Nor how it may concern my modesty,
In such a presence here to plead my thoughts;
But I beseech your grace that I may know
The worst that may befall me in this case,
If I refuse to wed Demetrius.

HERMIA ^
Please forgive me for speaking so boldly. I don't know what's come over me, but I need to know the worst that can happen if I don't marry Demetrius.

THESEUS
Either to die the death or to abjure
For ever the society of men.
Therefore, fair Hermia, question your desires;
Know of your youth, examine well your blood,
Whether, if you yield not to your father's choice,
You can endure the livery of a nun,
For aye to be in shady cloister mew'd,
To live a barren sister all your life,
Chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon.
Thrice-blessed they that master so their blood,
To undergo such maiden pilgrimage;
But earthlier happy is the rose distill'd,
Than that which withering on the virgin thorn
Grows, lives and dies in single blessedness.

THESEUS ^
You have two choices: either face death or give up men forever. So think carefully, Hermia. If you don't agree with your father, are you ready to live like a nun, locked away, singing hymns for the rest of your life? Some might say it's a blessing to live such a chaste life, but even a rose that's picked and distilled is happier than one that withers away untouched.

HERMIA
So will I grow, so live, so die, my lord,
Ere I will my virgin patent up
Unto his lordship, whose unwished yoke
My soul consents not to give sovereignty.

HERMIA ^
I'd rather live and die alone, my lord, than be with someone I don't love. I won't give up my freedom to a man I don't want.

THESEUS
Take time to pause; and, by the next new moon--
The sealing-day betwixt my love and me,
For everlasting bond of fellowship--
Upon that day either prepare to die
For disobedience to your father's will,
Or else to wed Demetrius, as he would;
Or on Diana's altar to protest
For aye austerity and single life.

THESEUS ^
Take some time to think. By the next new moon, which is also my wedding day, you must decide. Either prepare to die for disobeying your father, marry Demetrius as he wishes, or vow to live a single life forever at Diana's altar.

DEMETRIUS
Relent, sweet Hermia: and, Lysander, yield
Thy crazed title to my certain right.

DEMETRIUS ^
Give in, Hermia. And Lysander, give up your ridiculous claim; she's mine by right.

LYSANDER
You have her father's love, Demetrius;
Let me have Hermia's: do you marry him.

LYSANDER ^
You've got her father's approval, Demetrius. Let me have Hermia's love; you can have her father.

LYSANDER
I am, my lord, as well derived as he,
As well possess'd; my love is more than his;
My fortunes every way as fairly rank'd,
If not with vantage, as Demetrius';
And, which is more than all these boasts can be,
I am beloved of beauteous Hermia:
Why should not I then prosecute my right?
Demetrius, I'll avouch it to his head,
Made love to Nedar's daughter, Helena,
And won her soul; and she, sweet lady, dotes,
Devoutly dotes, dotes in idolatry,
Upon this spotted and inconstant man.

LYSANDER ^
I'm just as noble as Demetrius, just as wealthy. I love Hermia more than he does, and what's more, she loves me back. So why shouldn't I fight for what's rightfully mine? I'll say it straight to Demetrius: he wooed Helena, Nedar's daughter, and won her heart. And now she's head over heels, completely infatuated with this unreliable man.

THESEUS
I must confess that I have heard so much,
And with Demetrius thought to have spoke thereof;
But, being over-full of self-affairs,
My mind did lose it. But, Demetrius, come;
And come, Egeus; you shall go with me,
I have some private schooling for you both.
For you, fair Hermia, look you arm yourself
To fit your fancies to your father's will;
Or else the law of Athens yields you up--
Which by no means we may extenuate--
To death, or to a vow of single life.
Come, my Hippolyta: what cheer, my love?
Demetrius and Egeus, go along:
I must employ you in some business
Against our nuptial and confer with you
Of something nearly that concerns yourselves.

THESEUS ^
I admit, I've heard about this situation before, but I got sidetracked with my own matters. Demetrius, Egeus, come with me; we have some private matters to discuss. Hermia, prepare yourself to obey your father, or face the consequences—either death or a life of solitude. Now, let's go; I have some business to discuss with you both that's relevant to our upcoming wedding.

EGEUS
With duty and desire we follow you.

EGEUS ^
We follow you willingly and dutifully.

INT. ATHENS - ROYAL PALACE - DAY - CONTINUOUS

LYSANDER
How now, my love! why is your cheek so pale?
How chance the roses there do fade so fast?

LYSANDER ^
What's the matter, my love? Why do you look so pale? Why are the roses in your cheeks fading so quickly?

HERMIA
Belike for want of rain, which I could well
Beteem them from the tempest of my eyes.

HERMIA ^
Probably because they lack the rain that I could easily provide from the storm in my eyes.

LYSANDER
Ay me! for aught that I could ever read,
Could ever hear by tale or history,
The course of true love never did run smooth;
But, either it was different in blood,-

LYSANDER ^
Oh, from what I've read and heard, the path of true love is never easy; it's either complicated by family differences-

HERMIA
O cross! too high to be enthrall'd to low.

HERMIA ^
Oh, what a challenge! To be caught between high expectations and low realities.

LYSANDER
Or else misgraffed in respect of years,-

LYSANDER ^
Or mismatched in terms of age-

HERMIA
O spite! too old to be engaged to young.

HERMIA ^
Oh, the irony! Too old to be with someone so young.

LYSANDER
Or else it stood upon the choice of friends,-

LYSANDER ^
Or it's all about who your friends think you should be with-

HERMIA
O hell! to choose love by another's eyes.

HERMIA ^
Oh, hell! To have your love life dictated by someone else's opinion.

LYSANDER
Or, if there were a sympathy in choice,
War, death, or sickness did lay siege to it,
Making it momentany as a sound,
Swift as a shadow, short as any dream;
Brief as the lightning in the collied night,
That, in a spleen, unfolds both heaven and earth,
And ere a man hath power to say 'Behold!'
The jaws of darkness do devour it up:
So quick bright things come to confusion.

LYSANDER ^
Or, if love seemed perfect for a moment, it was quickly threatened by war, death, or illness. It's as fleeting as a sound, as quick as a shadow, as brief as a dream. Just like lightning that briefly illuminates the night, love can vanish before you even have a chance to appreciate it.

HERMIA
If then true lovers have been ever cross'd,
It stands as an edict in destiny:
Then let us teach our trial patience,
Because it is a customary cross,
As due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs,
Wishes and tears, poor fancy's followers.

HERMIA ^
If true love has always faced obstacles, then it's just fate. We should learn to be patient through these trials. After all, challenges are as much a part of love as are thoughts, dreams, sighs, wishes, and tears.

LYSANDER
A good persuasion: therefore, hear me, Hermia.
I have a widow aunt, a dowager
Of great revenue, and she hath no child:
From Athens is her house remote seven leagues;
And she respects me as her only son.
There, gentle Hermia, may I marry thee;
And to that place the sharp Athenian law
Cannot pursue us. If thou lovest me then,
Steal forth thy father's house to-morrow night;
And in the wood, a league without the town,
Where I did meet thee once with Helena,
To do observance to a morn of May,
There will I stay for thee.

LYSANDER ^
Listen, Hermia, I've got a plan. My aunt, who's a widow with a lot of money and no kids, lives seven leagues away from Athens. She treats me like her own son. We can get married there, far from the laws that would separate us. Meet me tomorrow night in the woods where we once met with Helena. I'll wait for you there.

HERMIA
My good Lysander!
I swear to thee, by Cupid's strongest bow,
By his best arrow with the golden head,
By the simplicity of Venus' doves,
By that which knitteth souls and prospers loves,
And by that fire which burn'd the Carthage queen,
When the false Troyan under sail was seen,
By all the vows that ever men have broke,
In number more than ever women spoke,
In that same place thou hast appointed me,
To-morrow truly will I meet with thee.

HERMIA ^
Oh, Lysander! I swear by all things romantic and divine, I'll meet you there tomorrow. You can count on it.

LYSANDER
Keep promise, love. Look, here comes Helena.

LYSANDER ^
Keep your promise, love. Oh, look, Helena's coming.


INT. ATHENS - ROYAL PALACE - DAY - CONTINUOUS

Enter Helena.

HERMIA
God speed fair Helena! whither away?

HERMIA ^
Hey Helena, where are you off to?

HELENA
Call you me fair? that fair again unsay.
Demetrius loves your fair: O happy fair!
Your eyes are lode-stars; and your tongue's sweet air
More tuneable than lark to shepherd's ear,
When wheat is green, when hawthorn buds appear.
Sickness is catching: O, were favour so,
Yours would I catch, fair Hermia, ere I go;
My ear should catch your voice, my eye your eye,
My tongue should catch your tongue's sweet melody.
Were the world mine, Demetrius being bated,
The rest I'd give to be to you translated.
O, teach me how you look, and with what art
You sway the motion of Demetrius' heart.

HELENA ^
You're calling me fair? Demetrius thinks you're the fair one. You're so lucky! Your eyes are like stars, and your voice is sweeter than a bird's song. If only beauty were contagious, I'd catch yours in a heartbeat. If I could, I'd trade places with you just to win Demetrius' love. Teach me how you do it, how you've captured his heart.

HERMIA
I frown upon him, yet he loves me still.

HERMIA ^
I'm not even nice to him, but he's still into me.

HELENA
O that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill!

HELENA ^
I wish my smiles had the power your frowns do!

HERMIA
I give him curses, yet he gives me love.

HERMIA ^
I push him away, but he keeps coming back.

HELENA
O that my prayers could such affection move!

HELENA ^
If only my love could make him feel the same way!

HERMIA
The more I hate, the more he follows me.

HERMIA ^
The less I care, the more he's into me.

HELENA
The more I love, the more he hateth me.

HELENA ^
The more I want him, the less he wants me.

HERMIA
His folly, Helena, is no fault of mine.

HERMIA ^
It's not my fault he's acting this way, Helena.

HELENA
None, but your beauty: would that fault were mine!

HELENA ^
It's all because you're gorgeous. I wish I had that problem!

(Insert cut scene here ?)

HERMIA
Take comfort: he no more shall see my face;  
Lysander and myself will fly this place.  
Before the time I did Lysander see,  
Seem'd Athens as a paradise to me:  
O, then, what graces in my love do dwell,  
That he hath turn'd a heaven unto a hell!

HERMIA^
Don't worry, he won't see me again;  
Lysander and I are leaving this place.  
Before I met Lysander, Athens seemed perfect to me.  
But now, the love I have for him  
Has turned what was heaven into hell.  

LYSANDER
Helen, to you our minds we will unfold:  
To-morrow night, when Phoebe doth behold  
Her silver visage in the watery glass,  
Decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass,  
A time that lovers' flights doth still conceal,  
Through Athens' gates have we devised to steal.

LYSANDER^
Helen, we'll let you in on our plan:  
Tomorrow night, when the moon shines bright  
Reflecting its light on the dewy grass,  
A time when lovers often sneak away,  
We're planning to slip out of Athens.

HERMIA
And in the wood, where often you and I  
Upon faint primrose beds were wont to lie,  
Emptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet,  
There my Lysander and myself shall meet;  
And thence from Athens turn away our eyes,  
To seek new friends and stranger companies.  
Farewell, sweet playfellow: pray thou for us;  
And good luck grant thee thy Demetrius!  
Keep word, Lysander: we must starve our sight  
From lovers' food till morrow deep midnight.

HERMIA^
And in that forest, where you and I used to lay  
On beds of primroses and share our deepest thoughts,  
That's where Lysander and I will meet.  
From there, we'll leave Athens behind,  
To find new friends and new experiences.  
Goodbye, dear friend: pray for us;  
And may you find happiness with Demetrius!  
Lysander, keep your promise: we'll avoid  
Seeing each other until tomorrow at midnight.

LYSANDER
I will, Helena, adieu: as you on him,  
Demetrius dote on you!

LYSANDER^
I will, Helena, goodbye: just as you love him,  
May Demetrius fall for you!

INT. ATHENS - ROYAL PALACE - DAY - CONTINUOUS

HELENA
How happy some o'er other some can be!
Through Athens I am thought as fair as she.
But what of that? Demetrius thinks not so;
He will not know what all but he do know:
And as he errs, doting on Hermia's eyes,
So I, admiring of his qualities:
Things base and vile, folding no quantity,
Love can transpose to form and dignity:
Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind;
And therefore is wing'd Cupid painted blind:
Nor hath Love's mind of any judgement taste;
Wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste:
And therefore is Love said to be a child,
Because in choice he is so oft beguiled.
As waggish boys in game themselves forswear,
So the boy Love is perjured every where:
For ere Demetrius look'd on Hermia's eyne,
He hail'd down oaths that he was only mine;
And when this hail some heat from Hermia felt,
So he dissolved, and showers of oaths did melt.
I will go tell him of fair Hermia's flight:
Then to the wood will he to-morrow night
Pursue her; and for this intelligence
If I have thanks, it is a dear expense:
But herein mean I to enrich my pain,
To have his sight thither and back again.

HELENA ^
How some people are happier than others! In Athens, I'm considered as beautiful as her. But what does that matter? Demetrius doesn't think so. He's blind to what everyone else can see. Just as he's infatuated with Hermia, I'm smitten with him. Even the most worthless things, love can elevate to something meaningful. Love isn't about looks, it's about feelings. That's why Cupid is often depicted as blind. Love doesn't think logically. It acts hastily, without seeing the consequences. That's why Love is said to be like a child, easily fooled and often making poor choices. Just as mischievous kids lie during games, love is also deceitful. Before Demetrius ever saw Hermia, he swore he was only interested in me. But as soon as he felt something for Hermia, his promises evaporated. I'll go tell him about Hermia running away. He'll chase after her in the woods tomorrow night. If he thanks me for this, it'll be a costly reward. But my real goal is to see him again, even if it hurts.

INT. ATHENS - QUINCE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Enter QUINCE, SNUG, BOTTOM, FLUTE, SNOUT, and STARVELING

QUINCE
Is all our company here?

QUINCE ^
Is everyone here?

BOTTOM
You were best to call them generally, man by man, according to the scrip.

BOTTOM ^
You should probably call everyone one by one, just like it says in the script.

QUINCE
Here is the scroll of every man's name, which is thought fit, through all Athens, to play in our interlude before the duke and the duchess, on his wedding-day at night.

QUINCE ^
Here's the list of everyone who's been chosen to perform in our play for the duke and duchess on their wedding night.

BOTTOM
First, good Peter Quince, say what the play treats on, then read the names of the actors, and so grow to a point.

BOTTOM ^
First, tell us what the play is about, Peter Quince. Then read out the names of the actors. Let's get to the point.


QUINCE
Marry, our play is, The most lamentable comedy, and most cruel death of Pyramus and Thisby.

QUINCE ^
Well, our play is called "The Most Lamentable Comedy and Most Cruel Death of Pyramus and Thisby."

BOTTOM
A very good piece of work, I assure you, and a merry. Now, good Peter Quince, call forth your actors by the scroll. Masters, spread yourselves.

BOTTOM ^
Sounds like a great and entertaining play. Now, Peter Quince, call out the actors from the list. Everyone, pay attention.

QUINCE
Answer as I call you. Nick Bottom, the weaver.

QUINCE ^
Respond when I call your name. Nick Bottom, the weaver, you're up.

BOTTOM
Ready. Name what part I am for, and proceed.

BOTTOM ^
I'm ready. Tell me what role I have and let's move on.


QUINCE
You, Nick Bottom, are set down for Pyramus.

QUINCE ^
Nick Bottom, you're cast as Pyramus.

BOTTOM
What is Pyramus? a lover, or a tyrant?

BOTTOM ^
What's Pyramus? A romantic or a dictator?

QUINCE
A lover, that kills himself most gallant for love.

QUINCE ^
A lover who bravely takes his own life for love.

BOTTOM
That will ask some tears in the true performing of it: if I do it, let the audience look to their eyes; I will move storms, I will condole in some measure.

BOTTOM ^
That's gonna require some real emotion. If I do it, the audience better have tissues; I'll bring the house down, I'll make 'em feel it.

QUINCE
To the rest: yet my chief humour is for a tyrant: I could play Ercles rarely, or a part to tear a cat in, to make all split.

QUINCE ^
As for the other roles, I'm really feeling the tyrant vibe. I could totally nail playing Ercles, or any role that requires tearing it up.

BOTTOM
The raging rocks
And shivering shocks
Shall break the locks
Of prison gates;
And Phibbus' car
Shall shine from far
And make and mar
The foolish Fates.

BOTTOM ^
The rocks will rage,
The shocks will shake,
And prison gates
Will surely break.
Phibbus' ride
Will shine so wide,
It'll mess with Fate,
Both make and bide.

QUINCE
This was lofty! Now name the rest of the players. This is Ercles' vein, a tyrant's vein; a lover is more condoling.

QUINCE ^
Wow, that was intense! Now, let's hear about the other roles. This is totally in the style of Ercles, very tyrannical. But remember, a lover's role requires more empathy.

FLUTE
Here, Peter Quince.

FLUTE ^
I'm here, Peter Quince.

QUINCE
Flute, you must take Thisby on you.

QUINCE ^
Flute, you're going to play Thisby.

FLUTE
What is Thisby? a wandering knight?

FLUTE ^
Who's Thisby? Some kind of roving hero?

QUINCE
It is the lady that Pyramus must love.

QUINCE ^
She's the lady that Pyramus is head over heels for.

FLUTE
Nay, faith, let me not play a woman; I have a beard coming.

FLUTE ^
Hold on, I can't play a woman; I've got some facial hair sprouting.

QUINCE
That's all one: you shall play it in a mask, and you may speak as small as you will.

QUINCE ^
No worries: you'll wear a mask, and you can use a high-pitched voice if you want.

BOTTOM
An I may hide my face, let me play Thisby too, I'll speak in a monstrous little voice. 'Thisne, Thisne;' 'Ah, Pyramus, lover dear! thy Thisby dear, and lady dear!'

BOTTOM ^
If I can wear a mask, let me play Thisby as well. I'll use a ridiculously tiny voice. 'Thisne, Thisne;' 'Ah, Pyramus, my love! Your Thisby, your lady!'

QUINCE
No, no; you must play Pyramus: and, Flute, you Thisby.

QUINCE ^
No, no; you're stuck with Pyramus. And Flute, you're Thisby.

BOTTOM
Well, proceed.

BOTTOM ^
Alright, go on.

QUINCE
Robin Starveling, the tailor.

QUINCE ^
Robin Starveling, you're the tailor.

STARVELING
Here, Peter Quince.

STARVELING ^
I'm here, Peter Quince.

QUINCE
Robin Starveling, you must play Thisby's mother.

QUINCE ^
Robin Starveling, you're cast as Thisby's mother.

QUINCE
Tom Snout, the tinker.

QUINCE ^
Tom Snout, the handyman.

SNOUT
Here, Peter Quince.

SNOUT ^
I'm here, Peter Quince.

QUINCE
You, Pyramus' father: myself, Thisby's father: Snug, the joiner; you, the lion's part: and, I hope, here is a play fitted.

QUINCE ^
You'll be Pyramus' dad. I'll be Thisby's dad. Snug, you're the carpenter, and you'll play the lion. Hopefully, we've got a well-cast play now.

SNUG
Have you the lion's part written? pray you, if it be, give it me, for I am slow of study.

SNUG ^
Do you have the lion's part written down? If you do, could you give it to me? I'm a slow learner.

QUINCE
You may do it extempore, for it is nothing but roaring.

QUINCE ^
You can improvise; all you have to do is roar.

BOTTOM
Let me play the lion too: I will roar, that I will do any man's heart good to hear me; I will roar, that I will make the duke say 'Let him roar again, let him roar again.'

BOTTOM ^
Let me play the lion as well! I'll roar so well it'll warm anyone's heart. I'll roar so well the duke will ask for an encore!

QUINCE
An you should do it too terribly, you would fright the duchess and the ladies, that they would shriek; and that were enough to hang us all.

QUINCE ^
If you roar too loudly, you'll scare the duchess and the ladies. They'll scream, and we'll all get in trouble.

ALL
That would hang us, every mother's son.

ALL ^
We'd all be doomed, every last one of us.

BOTTOM
I grant you, friends, if that you should fright the ladies out of their wits, they would have no more discretion but to hang us: but I will aggravate my voice so that I will roar you as gently as any sucking dove; I will roar you an 'twere any nightingale.

BOTTOM ^
I agree, if we scare the ladies too much, we're all in hot water. But don't worry, I'll tone it down. I'll roar as gently as a dove or a nightingale.

QUINCE
You can play no part but Pyramus; for Pyramus is a sweet-faced man; a proper man, as one shall see in a summer's day; a most lovely gentleman-like man: therefore you must needs play Pyramus.

QUINCE ^
You're only suited for Pyramus, who's supposed to be handsome and gentlemanly. So, you have to play Pyramus.

BOTTOM
Well, I will undertake it. What beard were I best to play it in?

BOTTOM ^
Alright, I'll do it. Which beard should I wear for the role?

QUINCE
Why, what you will.

QUINCE ^
Whatever you like, really.

BOTTOM
I will discharge it in either your straw-colour beard, your orange-tawny beard, your purple-in-grain beard, or your French-crown-colour beard, your perfect yellow.

BOTTOM ^
I can pull it off with any beard—straw-colored, orange-tawny, purple, or even French-crown yellow.

QUINCE
Some of your French crowns have no hair at all, and then you will play bare-faced.

QUINCE ^
Well, some French crowns are bald, so you might end up playing the role without a beard at all.

BOTTOM
But, masters, here are your parts: and I am to entreat you, request you and desire you, to con them by to-morrow night; and meet me in the palace wood, a mile without the town, by moonlight; there will we rehearse, for if we meet in the city, we shall be dogged with company, and our devices known.

BOTTOM ^
Alright, everyone, here are your scripts. Make sure to memorize your lines by tomorrow night. We'll meet in the palace woods, a mile outside of town, to rehearse. We can't risk being seen in the city.

QUINCE
In the meantime I will draw a bill of properties, such as our play wants. I pray you, fail me not.

QUINCE ^
In the meantime, I'll make a list of props we'll need for the play. Please, don't let me down.

BOTTOM
We will meet; and there we may rehearse most obscenely and courageously. Take pains; be perfect: adieu.

BOTTOM ^
We'll meet up, and we'll rehearse like there's no tomorrow. Give it your all; strive for perfection. See ya!

QUINCE
At the duke's oak we meet.

QUINCE ^
We'll meet at the Duke's Oak tree.

BOTTOM
Enough; hold or cut bow-strings.

BOTTOM ^
Enough said; it's do or die now.

EXT. A WOOD NEAR ATHENS - NIGHT

Enter, from opposite sides, a Fairy, and PUCK

PUCK
How now, spirit! whither wander you?

PUCK ^
Hey, what's up? Where are you off to?

FAIRY
Over hill, over dale, Thorough bush, thorough brier, Over park, over pale, Thorough flood, thorough fire, I do wander everywhere, Swifter than the moon's sphere; And I serve the fairy queen, To dew her orbs upon the green. The cowslips tall her pensioners be: In their gold coats spots you see; Those be rubies, fairy favours, In those freckles live their savours: I must go seek some dewdrops here And hang a pearl in every cowslip's ear. Farewell, thou lob of spirits; I'll be gone: Our queen and all our elves come here anon.

FAIRY ^
Up hills, down dales, through bushes and thorns, across parks and fences, through water and fire—I'm everywhere, faster than the moon orbits. I work for the fairy queen, making sure her world is dewy fresh. The tall cowslips are her special guards; their golden coats are actually full of ruby-like spots, which are fairy treats. Now, I gotta go find some dewdrops and hang them like pearls on every cowslip. Later, you big lump of spirit! Our queen and all her elves will be here soon.

PUCK
The king doth keep his revels here to-night:
Take heed the queen come not within his sight; For Oberon is passing fell and wrath,
Because that she as her attendant hath
A lovely boy, stolen from an Indian king;
She never had so sweet a changeling;
And jealous Oberon would have the child
Knight of his train, to trace the forests wild; But she perforce withholds the loved boy,
Crowns him with flowers and makes him all her joy: And now they never meet in grove or green,
By fountain clear, or spangled starlight sheen, But, they do square, that all their elves for fear Creep into acorn-cups and hide them there.

PUCK ^
The king's throwing a party tonight, and he's super mad at the queen. She's got this awesome kid she won't give up, and Oberon's super jelly. He wants the kid to be part of his crew, running wild in the forests. But the queen's not giving him up; she's too busy making flower crowns for him. Now, they can't even stand to be in the same place, whether it's a forest, by a clear fountain, or under the stars. They fight so much, all the little fairies are scared and hide in acorn cups.

FAIRY
Either I mistake your shape and making quite,
Or else you are that shrewd and knavish sprite Call'd Robin Goodfellow: are not you he
That frights the maidens of the villagery;
Skim milk, and sometimes labour in the quern
And bootless make the breathless housewife churn; And sometime make the drink to bear no barm; Mislead night-wanderers, laughing at their harm? Those that Hobgoblin call you and sweet Puck,
You do their work, and they shall have good luck: Are not you he?

FAIRY ^
Either I'm totally wrong about what you look like, or you're that sneaky trickster known as Robin Goodfellow, right? Aren't you the one who scares village girls, messes with milk, and makes housewives' work pointless? You even ruin drinks and lead people astray at night, all while laughing at their misfortune. People call you Hobgoblin and sweet Puck, and you bring them good luck when you do their bidding. That's you, isn't it?

PUCK
Thou speak'st aright;
I am that merry wanderer of the night.
I jest to Oberon and make him smile
When I a fat and bean-fed horse beguile, Neighing in likeness of a filly foal: And sometime lurk I in a gossip's bowl, In very likeness of a roasted crab,
And when she drinks, against her lips I bob
And on her wither'd dewlap pour the ale.
The wisest aunt, telling the saddest tale,
Sometime for three-foot stool mistaketh me;
Then slip I from her bum, down topples she,
And 'tailor' cries, and falls into a cough;
And then the whole quire hold their hips and laugh, And waxen in their mirth and neeze and swear
A merrier hour was never wasted there. But, room, fairy! here comes Oberon.

PUCK ^
You got it right; I'm the jester of the night. I make Oberon laugh by tricking fat horses into thinking I'm a young foal. Sometimes, I hide in a gossip's drink, looking like a roasted crab, and mess with her when she takes a sip. I've even been mistaken for a stool by a wise old lady, making her fall and everyone laugh. But hey, make way! Oberon's coming.

---

FAIRY
And here my mistress. Would that he were gone!

FAIRY ^
And here comes my queen. I wish he'd just leave.

EXT. A WOOD NEAR ATHENS - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

Enter, from one side, OBERON, with his train; from the other, TITANIA, with hers

OBERON
Ill met by moonlight, proud Titania.

OBERON ^
Bad timing, meeting under the moon, Titania.

TITANIA
What, jealous Oberon! Fairies, skip hence:
I have forsworn his bed and company.

TITANIA ^
What's the matter, Oberon? Jealous much? Fairies, leave us. I'm done sharing a bed or any time with him.

OBERON
Tarry, rash wanton: am not I thy lord?

OBERON ^
Hold on, you impulsive woman. Aren't I your king?

TITANIA
Then I must be thy lady: but I know
When thou hast stolen away from fairy land, And in the shape of Corin sat all day, Playing on pipes of corn and versing love To amorous Phillida. Why art thou here, Come from the farthest Steppe of India?
But that, forsooth, the bouncing Amazon,
Your buskin'd mistress and your warrior love, To Theseus must be wedded, and you come
To give their bed joy and prosperity.

TITANIA ^
If you're my king, then I'm your queen. But I know you've snuck away from fairyland before, pretending to be someone else and flirting all day. Why are you even here? Is it because your warrior girlfriend is getting married to Theseus and you want to bless their marriage?

OBERON
How canst thou thus for shame, Titania,
Glance at my credit with Hippolyta,
Knowing I know thy love to Theseus?
Didst thou not lead him through the glimmering night From Perigenia, whom he ravished?
And make him with fair AEgle break his faith,
With Ariadne and Antiopa?

OBERON ^
How can you shame me like this, Titania, bringing up Hippolyta when you know about your own history with Theseus? Weren't you the one who guided him through the night, away from Perigenia, whom he took by force? Didn't you also make him break his promises to Aegle, Ariadne, and Antiopa?

TITANIA
These are the forgeries of jealousy:
And never, since the middle summer's spring, Met we on hill, in dale, forest or mead,
By paved fountain or by rushy brook,
Or in the beached margent of the sea,
To dance our ringlets to the whistling wind,
But with thy brawls thou hast disturb'd our sport. Therefore the winds, piping to us in vain,
As in revenge, have suck'd up from the sea Contagious fogs; which falling in the land
Have every pelting river made so proud
That they have overborne their continents:
The ox hath therefore stretch'd his yoke in vain, The ploughman lost his sweat, and the green corn Hath rotted ere his youth attain'd a beard;
The fold stands empty in the drowned field,
And crows are fatted with the murrion flock;
The nine men's morris is fill'd up with mud,
And the quaint mazes in the wanton green
For lack of tread are undistinguishable:
The human mortals want their winter here;
No night is now with hymn or carol blest:
Therefore the moon, the governess of floods,
Pale in her anger, washes all the air, That rheumatic diseases do abound:
And thorough this distemperature we see The seasons alter: hoary-headed frosts Far in the fresh lap of the crimson rose, And on old Hiems' thin and icy crown
An odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds
Is, as in mockery, set: the spring, the summer, The childing autumn, angry winter, change
Their wonted liveries, and the mazed world,
By their increase, now knows not which is which: And this same progeny of evils comes
From our debate, from our dissension;
We are their parents and original.

TITANIA ^
This is all just your jealousy talking. Ever since last summer, every time we've met—whether it's on a hill, in a valley, by a fountain or stream, or even by the sea—we've been fighting. Your anger has disrupted nature itself. The winds, the rivers, the seasons, even the moon are all out of whack. Diseases are spreading, crops are failing, and animals are suffering. All of this chaos is because of our fighting. We're the cause of all these problems.

OBERON
Do you amend it then; it lies in you:
Why should Titania cross her Oberon? I do but beg a little changeling boy, To be my henchman.

OBERON ^
If you want to fix this, it's on you. Why are you defying me? All I'm asking for is that little boy to be my sidekick.

TITANIA
Set your heart at rest:
The fairy land buys not the child of me.
His mother was a votaress of my order:
And, in the spiced Indian air, by night,
Full often hath she gossip'd by my side,
And sat with me on Neptune's yellow sands,
Marking the embarked traders on the flood,
When we have laugh'd to see the sails conceive
And grow big-bellied with the wanton wind;
Which she, with pretty and with swimming gait Following,--her womb then rich with my young squire,-- Would imitate, and sail upon the land,
To fetch me trifles, and return again,
As from a voyage, rich with merchandise
But she, being mortal, of that boy did die; And for her sake do I rear up her boy,
And for her sake I will not part with him.

TITANIA ^
Forget it. I'm not giving you the child. His mom was a close friend of mine. We used to hang out on the beach at night, watching ships and laughing at the wind filling their sails. She'd even pretend to be a ship, waddling around while pregnant with this boy. She died giving birth to him, and I'm raising him in her memory. There's no way I'm giving him up.

OBERON
How long within this wood intend you stay?

OBERON ^
How long are you planning to hang out in this forest?

TITANIA
Perchance till after Theseus' wedding-day.
If you will patiently dance in our round
And see our moonlight revels, go with us;
If not, shun me, and I will spare your haunts.

TITANIA ^
Maybe until after Theseus gets hitched. If you want to join our moonlit party, you're welcome. If not, stay away from me, and I'll stay away from you.

OBERON
Give me that boy, and I will go with thee.

OBERON ^
Give me the kid, and I'll join your party.

TITANIA
Not for thy fairy kingdom. Fairies, away!
We shall chide downright, if I longer stay.


TITANIA ^
Not even for your entire fairy realm. Let's go, fairies! If I stay any longer, there's going to be a real fight.

EXT. A WOOD NEAR ATHENS - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

EXIT Titania and her train.

OBERON
Well, go thy way: thou shalt not from this grove
Till I torment thee for this injury.
My gentle Puck, come hither. Thou rememberest Since once I sat upon a promontory,
And heard a mermaid on a dolphin's back
Uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath
That the rude sea grew civil at her song
And certain stars shot madly from their spheres, To hear the sea-maid's music.

OBERON ^
Alright, do what you want, but you're not leaving this forest until I've had my revenge. Puck, come here. You remember that time I was chilling on a cliff, listening to a mermaid sing? Her voice was so sweet, it even made the wild ocean behave. Stars literally fell from the sky just to hear her.

PUCK
I remember.

PUCK ^
Yeah, man, I remember. That was something else.

OBERON
That very time I saw, but thou couldst not,
Flying between the cold moon and the earth,
Cupid all arm'd: a certain aim he took
At a fair vestal throned by the west,
And loosed his love-shaft smartly from his bow,
As it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts;
But I might see young Cupid's fiery shaft
Quench'd in the chaste beams of the watery moon,
And the imperial votaress passed on,
In maiden meditation, fancy-free.
Yet mark'd I where the bolt of Cupid fell:
It fell upon a little western flower,
Before milk-white, now purple with love's wound,
And maidens call it love-in-idleness.
Fetch me that flower; the herb I shew'd thee once:
The juice of it on sleeping eye-lids laid
Will make or man or woman madly dote
Upon the next live creature that it sees.
Fetch me this herb; and be thou here again
Ere the leviathan can swim a league.

OBERON ^
That same night, you wouldn't believe it,
I saw Cupid, fully armed, flying between
the moon and Earth. He aimed his bow
at a beautiful woman sitting in the west
and let his love arrow fly.
But I saw Cupid's arrow get extinguished
by the moon's pure light, and the woman
moved on, free from love's grip.
I saw where the arrow landed,
on a small western flower,
once white, now purple from love's touch.
We call it love-in-idleness.
Get me that flower; remember the one I showed you?
Its juice, when applied to sleeping eyes,
will make anyone fall madly in love
with the first living thing they see.
Get it for me, and be back
before a whale can swim a mile.

PUCK
I'll put a girdle round about the earth
In forty minutes.

PUCK ^
I'll circle the Earth and be back
in less than an hour.

EXT. A WOOD NEAR ATHENS - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

Exit Puck.

OBERON
Having once this juice,
I'll watch Titania when she is asleep,
And drop the liquor of it in her eyes.
The next thing then she waking looks upon,
Be it on lion, bear, or wolf, or bull,
On meddling monkey, or on busy ape,
She shall pursue it with the soul of love:
And ere I take this charm from off her sight,
As I can take it with another herb,
I'll make her render up her page to me.
But who comes here? I am invisible;
And I will overhear their conference.

OBERON^
Once I have this potion,
I'll wait for Titania to fall asleep,
Then put a few drops in her eyes.
The next thing she sees when she wakes up,
Whether it's a lion, bear, wolf, or bull,
Or even a nosy monkey or busy ape,
She'll fall head over heels in love with it.
Before I remove the spell from her eyes,
Which I can do with another herb,
I'll make her give me her servant.
Who's coming now? I can't be seen;
I'll eavesdrop on their conversation.

EXT. A WOOD NEAR ATHENS - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

Enter DEMETRIUS, HELENA, following him

DEMETRIUS
I love thee not, therefore pursue me not.
Where is Lysander and fair Hermia?
The one I'll slay, the other slayeth me.
Thou told'st me they were stolen unto this wood;
And here am I, and wode within this wood,
Because I cannot meet my Hermia.
Hence, get thee gone, and follow me no more.

DEMETRIUS^
I don't love you, so stop following me.
Where are Lysander and Hermia?
I'll kill him, but she's killing me.
You said they ran off into this forest;
And here I am, frustrated and lost,
Because I can't find Hermia.
So go away and stop following me.

HELENA
You draw me, you hard-hearted adamant;
But yet you draw not iron, for my heart
Is true as steel: leave you your power to draw,
And I shall have no power to follow you.

HELENA^
You attract me like a magnet,
But you can't attract metal, because my heart
Is as loyal as steel: give up your pull,
And I won't be able to follow you.

DEMETRIUS
Do I entice you? do I speak you fair?
Or, rather, do I not in plainest truth
Tell you, I do not, nor I cannot love you?

DEMETRIUS^
Am I leading you on? Am I sweet-talking you?
Or am I being clear when I say,
I don't and can't love you?

HELENA
And even for that do I love you the more.
I am your spaniel; and, Demetrius,
The more you beat me, I will fawn on you:
Use me but as your spaniel, spurn me, strike me,
Neglect me, lose me; only give me leave,
Unworthy as I am, to follow you.
What worser place can I beg in your love,--
And yet a place of high respect with me,--
Than to be used as you use your dog?

HELENA^
And that's exactly why I love you more.
I'm like your loyal dog, Demetrius,
The more you mistreat me, the more I'll adore you:
Treat me like your dog, kick me, hit me,
Ignore me, forget me; just let me,
As unworthy as I am, follow you.
What worse role could I ask for in your love,
Yet a role I highly respect,
Than to be treated like you treat your dog?

DEMETRIUS
Tempt not too much the hatred of my spirit;
For I am sick when I do look on thee.

DEMETRIUS^
Don't push my patience too far;
I feel sick just looking at you.

HELENA
And I am sick when I look not on you.

HELENA^
And I feel sick when I can't see you.

DEMETRIUS
You do impeach your modesty too much,
To leave the city and commit yourself
Into the hands of one that loves you not;
To trust the opportunity of night
And the ill counsel of a desert place
With the rich worth of your virginity.

DEMETRIUS^
You're really compromising your dignity,
Leaving the city to follow someone who doesn't love you,
Trusting the cover of night
And the bad advice of a deserted place
With something as valuable as your purity.

HELENA
Your virtue is my privilege: for that
It is not night when I do see your face,
Therefore I think I am not in the night;
Nor doth this wood lack worlds of company,
For you in my respect are all the world:
Then how can it be said I am alone,
When all the world is here to look on me?

HELENA^
Your goodness is my safety net: because of it,
It's not night when I see your face,
So I don't think I'm in the dark;
This forest isn't lonely at all,
Because you're my whole world:
So how can I be alone,
When the whole world is here watching me?

DEMETRIUS
I'll run from thee and hide me in the brakes,
And leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts.

DEMETRIUS^
I'll run away from you and hide in the bushes,
Leaving you to the mercy of wild animals.

HELENA
The wildest hath not such a heart as you.
Run when you will, the story shall be changed:
Apollo flies, and Daphne holds the chase;
The dove pursues the griffin; the mild hind
Makes speed to catch the tiger; bootless speed,
When cowardice pursues and valour flies.

HELENA^
Even the wildest animal isn't as heartless as you.
Run if you want, the roles will be reversed:
Apollo runs away, and Daphne gives chase;
The dove chases the griffin; the gentle deer
Rushes to catch the tiger; it's pointless,
When the coward runs and bravery flees.

DEMETRIUS
I will not stay thy questions; let me go:
Or, if thou follow me, do not believe
But I shall do thee mischief in the wood.

DEMETRIUS^
I won't stick around to answer your questions; let me go.
And if you follow me, know that
I'll harm you in the forest.

HELENA
Ay, in the temple, in the town, the field,
You do me mischief. Fie, Demetrius!
Your wrongs do set a scandal on my sex:
We cannot fight for love, as men may do;
We should be wood and were not made to woo.

HELENA^
You harm me everywhere—temple, town, field.
Shame on you, Demetrius!
Your actions disgrace women:
We can't fight for love like men;
We're supposed to be passive, not the ones doing the chasing.

EXT. A WOOD NEAR ATHENS - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

Exit DEMETRIUS

HELENA
I'll follow thee and make a heaven of hell,
To die upon the hand I love so well.

HELENA^
I'll follow you and turn hell into heaven,
Just to die by the hand of the one I love so much.

OBERON
Fare thee well, nymph: ere he do leave this grove,
Thou shalt fly him and he shall seek thy love.

OBERON^
Take care, nymph: before he leaves this forest,
You'll run from him and he'll chase after you.

OBERON
Hast thou the flower there? Welcome, wanderer.

OBERON^
Do you have the flower? Welcome back, traveler.

PUCK
Ay, there it is.

PUCK^
Yep, got it right here.

OBERON
I pray thee, give it me.
I know a bank where the wild thyme blows,
Where oxlips and the nodding violet grows,
Quite over-canopied with luscious woodbine,
With sweet musk-roses and with eglantine:
There sleeps Titania sometime of the night,
Lull'd in these flowers with dances and delight;
And there the snake throws her enamell'd skin,
Weed wide enough to wrap a fairy in:
And with the juice of this I'll streak her eyes,
And make her full of hateful fantasies.
Take thou some of it, and seek through this grove:
A sweet Athenian lady is in love
With a disdainful youth: anoint his eyes;
But do it when the next thing he espies
May be the lady: thou shalt know the man
By the Athenian garments he hath on.
Effect it with some care, that he may prove
More fond on her than she upon her love:
And look thou meet me ere the first cock crow.

OBERON^
Please, hand it over.
I know a spot where wild thyme grows,
Along with oxlips and nodding violets,
Covered by lush woodbine,
And fragrant musk-roses and eglantine:
Titania sometimes sleeps there at night,
Soothed by these flowers and entranced by dances;
And there, snakes shed their colorful skin,
Wide enough to wrap a fairy in:
I'll use this juice to dab her eyes,
And fill her mind with hateful thoughts.
Take some and search the forest:
A lovely Athenian woman is smitten
With a guy who couldn't care less: dab his eyes;
But make sure the first thing he sees
Is her: you'll recognize him
By the Athenian clothes he's wearing.
Be careful, so he ends up
More in love with her than she is with him:
And meet me before the rooster crows.

PUCK
Fear not, my lord, your servant shall do so.

PUCK^
Don't worry, boss, I'll get it done.

Enter TITANIA, with her train

TITANIA
Come, now a roundel and a fairy song;
Then, for the third part of a minute, hence;
Some to kill cankers in the musk-rose buds,
Some war with rere-mice for their leathern wings,
To make my small elves coats, and some keep back
The clamorous owl that nightly hoots and wonders
At our quaint spirits. Sing me now asleep;
Then to your offices and let me rest.


TITANIA^
Alright, let's have a dance and a fairy tune;
Then, for just a moment, scatter;
Some of you take care of the pests in the rosebuds,
Some fight with bats for their leather-like wings,
To make coats for my little elves, and some of you
Keep away the noisy owl that hoots and is amazed
By our magical presence. Sing me to sleep now;
Then go about your tasks and let me rest.

THE FAIRIES
(Sing)
You spotted snakes with double tongue,
Thorny hedgehogs, be not seen;
Newts and blind-worms, do no wrong,
Come not near our fairy queen.
Philomel, with melody
Sing in our sweet lullaby;
Lulla, lulla, lullaby, lulla, lulla, lullaby:
Never harm,
Nor spell nor charm,
Come our lovely lady nigh;
So, good night, with lullaby.
Weaving spiders, come not here;
Hence, you long-legg'd spinners, hence!
Beetles black, approach not near;
Worm nor snail, do no offence.

THE FAIRIES^
(Sing)
Spotted snakes with forked tongues,
Spiky hedgehogs, stay away;
Newts and blind-worms, do no harm,
Don't come near our fairy queen.
Philomel, with your sweet song,
Join our gentle lullaby;
Lulla, lulla, lullaby, lulla, lulla, lullaby:
No harm done,
No spells or curses,
Come near our lovely lady;
So, goodnight, with a lullaby.
Weaving spiders, stay away;
Long-legged spinners, go away!
Black beetles, don't come near;
Worms and snails, don't interfere.

FAIRY
Hence, away! now all is well:
One aloof stand sentinel.

FAIRY^
Go, go! Everything's fine now:
One of you, stand guard from a distance.

TITANIA falls asleep

Enter OBERON and squeezes the flower on TITANIA's eyelids

OBERON
What thou seest when thou dost wake,
Do it for thy true-love take,
Love and languish for his sake:
Be it ounce, or cat, or bear,
Pard, or boar with bristled hair,
In thy eye that shall appear
When thou wakest, it is thy dear:
Wake when some vile thing is near.

OBERON^
Whatever you see when you wake up,
Take it as your true love,
And pine for him:
Whether it's a lynx, or a cat, or a bear,
Leopard, or a boar with spiky fur,
Whatever catches your eye
When you wake, that's your love:
Wake up when something awful is near.

Enter LYSANDER and HERMIA

LYSANDER
Fair love, you faint with wandering in the wood;
And to speak troth, I have forgot our way:
We'll rest us, Hermia, if you think it good,
And tarry for the comfort of the day.

LYSANDER^
My love, you're tired from wandering in the forest;
And honestly, I've lost our way:
Let's rest, Hermia, if you're okay with it,
And wait for the daylight to comfort us.

HERMIA
Be it so, Lysander: find you out a bed;
For I upon this bank will rest my head.

HERMIA^
Sounds good, Lysander: find yourself a spot;
I'll rest my head on this bank here.

LYSANDER
One turf shall serve as pillow for us both;
One heart, one bed, two bosoms and one troth.

LYSANDER^
One patch of grass can be a pillow for both of us;
One heart, one resting place, two souls, one promise.

HERMIA
Nay, good Lysander; for my sake, my dear,
Lie further off yet, do not lie so near.

HERMIA^
No, Lysander; for my sake, please,
Keep some distance, don't lie so close.

LYSANDER
O, take the sense, sweet, of my innocence!
Love takes the meaning in love's conference.
I mean, that my heart unto yours is knit
So that but one heart we can make of it;
Two bosoms interchained with an oath;
So then two bosoms and a single troth.
Then by your side no bed-room me deny;
For lying so, Hermia, I do not lie.

LYSANDER^
Oh, understand the sincerity in my words!
Love finds its meaning when we talk about love.
My heart is so connected to yours,
That we can say we share one heart;
Two hearts bound together by a promise;
So, two hearts and one commitment.
Don't deny me a spot beside you;
For in doing so, Hermia, I'm not lying.

HERMIA
Lysander riddles very prettily:
Now much beshrew my manners and my pride,
If Hermia meant to say Lysander lied.
But, gentle friend, for love and courtesy
Lie further off; in human modesty,
Such separation as may well be said
Becomes a virtuous bachelor and a maid,
So far be distant; and, good night, sweet friend:
Thy love ne'er alter till thy sweet life end!

HERMIA^
Lysander, you speak in charming riddles:
I'd be rude and proud to say you're lying.
But, my dear friend, for the sake of love and decency,
Keep some distance; it's only proper,
For a respectful man and woman to keep some space.
So, let's keep our distance; good night, dear friend:
May your love never change until your life ends!

LYSANDER
Amen, amen, to that fair prayer, say I;
And then end life when I end loyalty!
Here is my bed: sleep give thee all his rest!

LYSANDER^
Amen to that beautiful prayer, I say;
And may my life end when my loyalty does!
Here's my resting spot: may sleep give you all its peace!

HERMIA
With half that wish the wisher's eyes be press'd!


HERMIA^
May the one who wishes that have peaceful sleep too!

PUCK
Through the forest have I gone.
But Athenian found I none,
On whose eyes I might approve
This flower's force in stirring love.
Night and silence. -- Who is here?
Weeds of Athens he doth wear:
This is he, my master said,
Despised the Athenian maid;
And here the maiden, sleeping sound,
On the dank and dirty ground.
Pretty soul! she durst not lie
Near this lack-love, this kill-courtesy.
Churl, upon thy eyes I throw
All the power this charm doth owe.
When thou wakest, let love forbid
Sleep his seat on thy eyelid:
So awake when I am gone;
For I must now to Oberon.


PUCK^
I've roamed through the forest,
But found no Athenian,
On whose eyes I could test
This flower's love potion.
It's night and quiet. -- Who's this?
Wearing Athenian clothes:
This is the guy, my boss said,
Who rejected the Athenian girl;
And here she is, sound asleep,
On the cold and filthy ground.
Poor thing! She wouldn't dare
Lie near this loveless, rude guy.
Dude, on your eyes I sprinkle
All the magic this charm holds.
When you wake, may love prevent
Sleep from closing your eyes:
Wake up after I leave;
I've got to go back to Oberon.

HELENA
O, I am out of breath in this fond chase!
The more my prayer, the lesser is my grace.
Happy is Hermia, wheresoe'er she lies;
For she hath blessed and attractive eyes.
How came her eyes so bright? Not with salt tears:
If so, my eyes are oftener wash'd than hers.
No, no, I am as ugly as a bear;
For beasts that meet me run away for fear:
Therefore no marvel though Demetrius
Do, as a monster fly my presence thus.
What wicked and dissembling glass of mine
Made me compare with Hermia's sphery eyne?
But who is here? Lysander! on the ground!
Dead? or asleep? I see no blood, no wound.
Lysander if you live, good sir, awake.

HELENA^
Oh, I'm out of breath from this crazy chase!
The more I pray, the less I feel grace.
Hermia's so lucky, wherever she is;
Her eyes are so beautiful, they're pure bliss.
Why are her eyes so bright? Not from tears:
If that's the case, I cry way more than she ever hears.
No, I'm as unattractive as a bear;
Animals run away from me in fear:
So it's no surprise that Demetrius
Runs away from me like I'm monstrous.
What mirror tricked me into thinking
I could compare to Hermia's eyes twinkling?
But who's this? Lysander! On the ground!
Dead or asleep? No blood or wounds I've found.
Lysander, if you're alive, please wake up.

LYSANDER 
(Awaking)
And run through fire I will for thy sweet sake.

LYSANDER^
(Awakening)
I'd run through fire for you, that's straight up.

LYSANDER 
Transparent Helena! Nature shows art,
That through thy bosom makes me see thy heart.
Where is Demetrius? O, how fit a word
Is that vile name to perish on my sword!

LYSANDER^
Helena, you're so transparent! It's like art,
I can see right through you, straight to your heart.
Where's Demetrius? Oh, what a fitting name
For someone I'd gladly run through with my blade!

HELENA
Do not say so, Lysander; say not so
What though he love your Hermia? Lord, what though?
Yet Hermia still loves you: then be content.

HELENA^
Don't say that, Lysander, don't.
So what if he loves Hermia? Seriously, so what?
Hermia still loves you, so be happy with that.

LYSANDER
Content with Hermia! No; I do repent
The tedious minutes I with her have spent.
Not Hermia but Helena I love:
Who will not change a raven for a dove?
The will of man is by his reason sway'd;
And reason says you are the worthier maid.
Things growing are not ripe until their season
So I, being young, till now ripe not to reason;
And touching now the point of human skill,
Reason becomes the marshal to my will
And leads me to your eyes, where I o'erlook
Love's stories written in love's richest book.

LYSANDER^
Happy with Hermia? No, I regret
Every boring minute I've spent with her.
It's not Hermia, it's you, Helena, I love:
Who wouldn't trade a raven for a dove?
People are guided by reason,
And reason says you're the better choice.
Things aren't ready until their time,
And I wasn't ready to be reasonable until now.
Now that I'm wiser, reason guides my will,
Leading me to your eyes, love's greatest thrill.

HELENA
Wherefore was I to this keen mockery born?
When at your hands did I deserve this scorn?
Is't not enough, is't not enough, young man,
That I did never, no, nor never can,
Deserve a sweet look from Demetrius' eye,
But you must flout my insufficiency?
Good troth, you do me wrong, good sooth, you do,
In such disdainful manner me to woo.
But fare you well: perforce I must confess
I thought you lord of more true gentleness.
O, that a lady, of one man refused.
Should of another therefore be abused!

HELENA^
Why was I born to be mocked like this?
What did I do to deserve your scorn?
Isn't it enough that I can't,
And never will, get a loving look from Demetrius,
Without you making fun of my shortcomings?
Honestly, you're doing me wrong, you really are,
Wooing me in such a disrespectful way.
Fine, go ahead: I thought you were a better man.
It's sad that a woman rejected by one man,
Gets mistreated by another.

LYSANDER
She sees not Hermia. Hermia, sleep thou there:
And never mayst thou come Lysander near!
For as a surfeit of the sweetest things
The deepest loathing to the stomach brings,
Or as tie heresies that men do leave
Are hated most of those they did deceive,
So thou, my surfeit and my heresy,
Of all be hated, but the most of me!
And, all my powers, address your love and might
To honour Helen and to be her knight!

LYSANDER^
She doesn't see Hermia. Hermia, stay asleep:
And never come near me again!
Just like too much of a good thing can make you sick,
Or how people hate the lies they used to believe,
You're my overindulgence and my mistake,
Hated by all, but especially by me!
Now, I'll focus all my love and strength
To honor Helena and be her knight!

To pluck this crawling serpent from my breast!
Ay me, for pity! what a dream was here!
Lysander, look how I do quake with fear:
Methought a serpent eat my heart away,
And you sat smiling at his cruel pray.
Lysander! what, removed? Lysander! lord!
What, out of hearing? gone? no sound, no word?
Alack, where are you speak, an if you hear;
Speak, of all loves! I swoon almost with fear.
No? then I well perceive you all not nigh
Either death or you I'll find immediately.

HERMIA^
(Awaking)
Help me, Lysander, help me! Get this snake off me!
Oh my God, what a nightmare!
Lysander, look, I'm shaking with fear:
I dreamt a snake was eating my heart,
And you were just sitting there, smiling.
Lysander! Where are you? Can't hear me?
Gone? No response?
Oh no, where are you? Speak if you can hear me;
Speak, for the love of God! I'm about to faint.
No? Then I get it, you're not here.
I'll find either death or you right away.

Enter QUINCE, SNUG, BOTTOM, FLUTE, SNOUT, and STARVELING

BOTTOM
Are we all met?

BOTTOM^
Is everyone here?

QUINCE
Pat, pat; and here's a marvellous convenient place
for our rehearsal. This green plot shall be our
stage, this hawthorn-brake our tiring-house; and we will do it in action as we will do it before the duke.

QUINCE^
Perfect, perfect; and this is a really great spot
for our rehearsal. This grassy area will be our
stage, and that hawthorn bush will be our dressing room; and we'll rehearse it just like we'll perform it for the duke.

BOTTOM
Peter Quince,--

BOTTOM^
Peter Quince,--

QUINCE
What sayest thou, bully Bottom?

QUINCE^
What's up, my man Bottom?

BOTTOM
There are things in this comedy of Pyramus and
Thisby that will never please. First, Pyramus must draw a sword to kill himself; which the ladies cannot abide. How answer you that?

BOTTOM^
There are parts in this comedy of Pyramus and
Thisbe that just won't work. First off, Pyramus has to pull out a sword to kill himself; and that's something the ladies won't be able to handle. What do you think?

SNOUT
By'r lakin, a parlous fear.

SNOUT^
By all means, that's a serious concern.

STARVELING
I believe we must leave the killing out, when all is done.

STARVELING^
I think we should just skip the killing scene altogether.

BOTTOM
Not a whit: I have a device to make all well.
Write me a prologue; and let the prologue seem to say, we will do no harm with our swords, and that Pyramus is not killed indeed; and, for the more better assurance, tell them that I, Pyramus, am not Pyramus, but Bottom the weaver: this will put them out of fear.

BOTTOM^
Not at all: I have a plan to make everything okay.
Write an introduction; and let the intro make it clear that we won't actually use our swords, and that Pyramus isn't really dead; and to make it even more clear, tell them that I, Pyramus, am actually Bottom the weaver: this will calm their fears.

QUINCE
Well, we will have such a prologue; and it shall be
written in eight and six.

QUINCE^
Alright, we'll have that kind of introduction; and it'll be
written in eight lines of six syllables each.

BOTTOM
No, make it two more; let it be written in eight and eight.

BOTTOM^
No, add two more lines; make it eight lines of eight syllables each.

SNOUT
Will not the ladies be afeard of the lion?

SNOUT^
Won't the ladies be scared of the lion?

STARVELING
I fear it, I promise you.

STARVELING^
I'm worried about that, for sure.


BOTTOM
Masters, you ought to consider with yourselves: to
bring in--God shield us!--a lion among ladies, is a most dreadful thing; for there is not a more fearful wild-fowl than your lion living; and we ought to look to 't.

BOTTOM^
Guys, we really need to think this through: bringing a lion into a room full of ladies is super scary; there's nothing more terrifying than a live lion, and we need to address that.

SNOUT
Therefore another prologue must tell he is not a lion.

SNOUT^
So we'll need another intro to clarify that he's not a real lion.

BOTTOM
Nay, you must name his name, and half his face must
be seen through the lion's neck: and he himself
must speak through, saying thus, or to the same defect,--'Ladies,'--or 'Fair-ladies--I would wish You,'--or 'I would request you,'--or 'I would
entreat you,--not to fear, not to tremble: my life
for yours. If you think I come hither as a lion, it were pity of my life: no I am no such thing; I am a man as other men are;' and there indeed let him name his name, and tell them plainly he is Snug the joiner.

BOTTOM^
Exactly, you have to say his name, and only half of his face should be visible through the lion's costume. He should say something like, 'Ladies, I assure you, don't be scared: I'm not a lion. I'm just a regular guy.' And then he should say his name and make it clear that he's actually Snug the carpenter.

QUINCE
Well it shall be so. But there is two hard things;
that is, to bring the moonlight into a chamber; for, you know, Pyramus and Thisby meet by moonlight.

QUINCE^
That works. But we have another issue; how do we bring moonlight into the room? Because, as you know, Pyramus and Thisbe meet under the moonlight.

SNOUT
Doth the moon shine that night we play our play?

SNOUT^
Will the moon be out the night we perform?

BOTTOM
A calendar, a calendar! look in the almanac; find
out moonshine, find out moonshine.

BOTTOM^
Check the calendar, check the calendar! Look it up, find out if the moon will be out.

QUINCE
Yes, it doth shine that night.

QUINCE^
Yes, the moon will be out that night.

BOTTOM
Why, then may you leave a casement of the great
chamber window, where we play, open, and the moon may shine in at the casement.

BOTTOM^
Great, then we can just leave one of the big windows in the room where we're performing open, and let the moonlight shine in.

QUINCE
Ay; or else one must come in with a bush of thorns
and a lanthorn, and say he comes to disfigure, or to present, the person of Moonshine. Then, there is another thing: we must have a wall in the great chamber; for Pyramus and Thisby says the story, did talk through the crack of a wall.

QUINCE^
Alternatively, someone could come in with a bunch of thorns and a lantern, pretending to be the moon. Also, we need a wall in the room where we're performing; the story says that Pyramus and Thisbe talked through a crack in a wall.

SNOUT
You can never bring in a wall. What say you, Bottom?

SNOUT^
A wall? That's not happening. What do you think, Bottom?

BOTTOM
Some man or other must present Wall: and let him
have some plaster, or some loam, or some rough-cast about him, to signify wall; and let him hold his fingers thus, and through that cranny shall Pyramus and Thisby whisper.

BOTTOM^
Someone has to play the role of the Wall. He can use plaster, mud, or some textured material to look like a wall. He can hold his fingers like this, and Pyramus and Thisbe can whisper through the gap.

QUINCE
If that may be, then all is well. Come, sit down,
every mother's son, and rehearse your parts. Pyramus, you begin: when you have spoken your speech, enter into that brake: and so every one according to his cue.

QUINCE^
If that works, then we're good to go. Everyone, take a seat and let's rehearse. Pyramus, you start. After your lines, go into those bushes, and everyone else follow your cues

Yes, you have to. Understand that he's just gone to check out a noise he heard and he'll be back.

Most radiant Pyramus, most lily-white of hue, Of colour like the red rose on triumphant brier, Most brisky juvenal and eke most lovely Jew, As true as truest horse that yet would never tire, I'll meet thee, Pyramus, at Ninny's tomb.

FLUTE^
Pyramus, you're amazing, as white as a lily, as red as a rose, energetic and also a lovely person. Just like a reliable horse, you never get tired. I'll meet you at Ninny's tomb.

QUINCE
'Ninus' tomb,' man: why, you must not speak that yet; that you answer to Pyramus: you speak all your part at once, cues and all Pyramus enter: your cue is past; it is, 'never tire.'

QUINCE^
It's 'Ninus' tomb,' not 'Ninny's.' Don't say that part yet; you're supposed to respond to Pyramus. You're saying all your lines at once, cues and all. You missed your cue; it was 'never tire.'

Please, kind mortal, sing again. I love the sound of your voice; I'm captivated by your appearance; and your goodness compels me to say, even swear, that I love you at first sight.

Methinks, mistress, you should have little reason for that: and yet, to say the truth, reason and love keep little company together now-a-days; the more the pity that some honest neighbours will not make them friends. Nay, I can gleek upon occasion.

I think you don't have much reason to say that, but to be honest, reason and love don't often go hand in hand these days. It's a shame that they can't be better friends. But hey, I can joke when the time is right.

Be nice and polite to this guy; Dance around him and catch his eye; Feed him apricots and berries, grapes, figs, and mulberries too; Steal honey from bees, and use their wax to make candles; Light them with the glow-worm's fire, so my love can sleep and wake; Take the wings from colorful butterflies to fan away the moonlight from his eyes; Nod at him, fairies, and be courteous.

What's the latest happening in this spooky forest?

PUCK
My mistress with a monster is in love.
Near to her close and consecrated bower,
While she was in her dull and sleeping hour,
A crew of patches, rude mechanicals,
That work for bread upon Athenian stalls,
Were met together to rehearse a play
Intended for great Theseus' nuptial-day.
The shallowest thick-skin of that barren sort, Who Pyramus presented, in their sport
Forsook his scene and enter'd in a brake
When I did him at this advantage take,
An ass's nole I fixed on his head:
Anon his Thisbe must be answered,
And forth my mimic comes. When they him spy,
As wild geese that the creeping fowler eye,
Or russet-pated choughs, many in sort,
Rising and cawing at the gun's report,
Sever themselves and madly sweep the sky,
So, at his sight, away his fellows fly;
And, at our stamp, here o'er and o'er one falls; He murder cries and help from Athens calls. Their sense thus weak, lost with their fears thus strong,
Made senseless things begin to do them wrong; For briers and thorns at their apparel snatch; Some sleeves, some hats, from yielders all things catch.
I led them on in this distracted fear,
And left sweet Pyramus translated there:
When in that moment, so it came to pass,
Titania waked and straightway loved an ass.

The dumbest guy among them, playing Pyramus, Left his spot and hid in the bushes. That's when I saw my chance, And stuck a donkey's head on him. Soon, his Thisbe had to reply, And out he comes. When they see him, They scatter like scared geese, Or noisy birds startled by agunshot. They all fly off in a panic, And he's left shouting for help.Their fear made them lose all sense, Getting caught in thorns and bushes,Losing hats and sleeves.I led them on this wild goose chase,And left Pyramus transformed: Just then, Titania woke up and fell in love with a donkey.

OBERON
This falls out better than I could devise. But hast thou yet latch'd the Athenian's eyes With the love-juice, as I did bid thee do?

OBERON^
This is even better than I planned. But did you manage to get the Athenian with the love potion like I told you to?

PUCK
I took him sleeping, - that is finish’d, too - 
And the Athenian woman by his side:
That, when he waked, of force she must be eyed.

PUCK^
I got him while he was asleep, so that's done.
And the Athenian woman was right next to him;
So, when he wakes up, he'll have to look at her.

OBERON
Stand close: this is the same Athenian.

OBERON^
Stay close: this is the Athenian I was talking about.

PUCK
This is the woman, but not this the man.

PUCK^
This is the right woman, but not the right man.

DEMETRIUS
O, why rebuke you him that loves you so?
Lay breath so bitter on your bitter foe.

DEMETRIUS^
Why are you so harsh to someone who loves you?
Why waste your anger on your enemy?

HERMIA
Now I but chide; but I should use thee worse,
For thou, I fear, hast given me cause to curse,
If thou hast slain Lysander in his sleep,
Being o'er shoes in blood, plunge in the deep,
And kill me too.
The sun was not so true unto the day
As he to me: would he have stolen away
From sleeping Hermia? I'll believe as soon
This whole earth may be bored and that the moon
May through the centre creep and so displease
Her brother's noontide with Antipodes.
It cannot be but thou hast murder'd him;
So should a murderer look, so dead, so grim.

HERMIA^
I'm just scolding you now, but I could do worse.
I think you've given me a reason to curse.
If you've killed Lysander while he was asleep,
You might as well go all in and kill me too.
Lysander was as faithful to me as the sun is to the day.
Would he really leave me while I was asleep?
I'd sooner believe the earth could be hollowed out
And the moon could pass through its center.
You must have killed him; you look like a murderer.

DEMETRIUS
So should the murder'd look, and so should I,
Pierced through the heart with your stern cruelty:
Yet you, the murderer, look as bright, as clear,
As yonder Venus in her glimmering sphere.

DEMETRIUS^
A murder victim would look like this, and so do I,
Stabbed in the heart by your harshness.
Yet you, the real killer, look as radiant as Venus in the sky.

HERMIA
What's this to my Lysander? where is he?
Ah, good Demetrius, wilt thou give him me?

HERMIA^
What does this have to do with Lysander? Where is he?
Demetrius, can you give him back to me?

DEMETRIUS
I had rather give his carcass to my hounds.

DEMETRIUS^
I'd rather feed his body to my dogs.

HERMIA
Out, dog! out, cur! thou drivest me past the bounds
Of maiden's patience. Hast thou slain him, then?
Henceforth be never number'd among men!
O, once tell true, tell true, even for my sake!
Durst thou have look'd upon him being awake,
And hast thou kill'd him sleeping? O brave touch!
Could not a worm, an adder, do so much?
An adder did it; for with doubler tongue
Than thine, thou serpent, never adder stung.

HERMIA^
Get lost, you dog, you coward! You've pushed me too far.
Did you kill him? If so, you're no longer a man in my eyes.
Just tell me the truth, for my sake!
Could you even look at him when he was awake,
And you killed him while he was asleep? How brave of you!
Even a worm or a snake could do that.
A snake did it; even a snake is less deceitful than you.

DEMETRIUS
You spend your passion on a misprised mood:
I am not guilty of Lysander's blood;
Nor is he dead, for aught that I can tell.

DEMETRIUS^
You're wasting your anger on a misunderstanding.
I didn't kill Lysander; as far as I know, he's not dead.

HERMIA
I pray thee, tell me then that he is well.

HERMIA^
Then please tell me he's okay.

DEMETRIUS
An if I could, what should I get therefore?

DEMETRIUS^
Even if I could tell you, what would I get out of it?

HERMIA
A privilege never to see me more.
And from thy hated presence part I so: See me no more, whether he be dead or no.

HERMIA^
The privilege of never seeing me again.
I'm leaving your hated presence: don't ever look for me, whether he's dead or alive.

Exit

EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE WOOD - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

DEMETRIUS
There is no following her in this fierce vein:
Here therefore for a while I will remain.
So sorrow's heaviness doth heavier grow
For debt that bankrupt sleep doth sorrow owe:
Which now in some slight measure it will pay,
If for his tender here I make some stay.

DEMETRIUS^
There's no point in chasing her when she's this mad.
So, I'll stay here for a bit.
My sadness is getting worse because I can't sleep,
And now I'll try to catch up on some rest.

Lies down and sleeps.

OBERON
What hast thou done? thou hast mistaken quite
And laid the love-juice on some true-love's sight:
Of thy misprision must perforce ensue
Some true love turn'd and not a false turn'd true.

OBERON^
What have you done? You've messed up big time,
Putting the love potion on the wrong person's eyes.
Now, real love is going to get twisted, not fake love turned real.

PUCK
Then fate o'er-rules, that, one man holding troth,
A million fail, confounding oath on oath.

PUCK^
Well, if fate's in charge, then one loyal guy
Is going to mess up a million other promises.

OBERON
About the wood go swifter than the wind,
And Helena of Athens look thou find:
All fancy-sick she is and pale of cheer,
With sighs of love, that costs the fresh blood dear:
By some illusion see thou bring her here:
I'll charm his eyes against she do appear.

OBERON^
Go through the forest faster than the wind,
And find Helena from Athens.
She's lovesick and looking miserable,
Sighing so much it's like she's losing blood.
Bring her here with some trick;
I'll make sure he falls for her when she shows up.

PUCK
I go, I go; look how I go,
Swifter than arrow from the Tartar's bow.

PUCK^
I'm on it, I'm on it; watch me go,
Faster than an arrow from a Tartar's bow.

Exit

OBERON
Flower of this purple dye,
Hit with Cupid's archery,
Sink in apple of his eye.
When his love he doth espy,
Let her shine as gloriously
As the Venus of the sky.
When thou wakest, if she be by,
Beg of her for remedy.

OBERON^
Flower with this purple hue,
Struck by Cupid's arrow too,
Become the focus of his view.
When he sees the one he's into,
Let her glow and really shine through,
Just like Venus in the sky so blue.
When he wakes up and she's in sight,
He should ask her to make it right.

Re-enter PUCK

PUCK
Captain of our fairy band,
Helena is here at hand;
And the youth, mistook by me,
Pleading for a lover's fee.
Shall we their fond pageant see?
Lord, what fools these mortals be!

PUCK^
Leader of our fairy crew,
Helena is here, it's true;
And the guy I messed up with,
Is begging for love, forthwith.
Should we watch this silly show?
Man, humans are dumb, you know.

OBERON
Stand aside: the noise they make
Will cause Demetrius to awake.

OBERON^
Step back: the noise they're making
Will wake Demetrius, no mistaking.

PUCK
Then will two at once woo one;
That must needs be sport alone;
And those things do best please me
That befal preposterously.

PUCK^
Then two guys will chase one girl;
That's gotta be fun in itself, unfurl;
And the things that make me laugh the most
Are the ones that happen totally messed.

Enter LYSANDER and HELENA

LYSANDER
Why should you think that I should woo in scorn?
Scorn and derision never come in tears:
Look, when I vow, I weep; and vows so born,
In their nativity all truth appears.
How can these things in me seem scorn to you,
Bearing the badge of faith, to prove them true?

LYSANDER^
Why would you think I'm mocking you?
Mockery and scorn don't come with tears.
Look, I'm crying as I make my vows;
So you should know they're sincere.
How can you think I'm not serious,
When I'm showing all the signs of being true?

HELENA
You do advance your cunning more and more.
When truth kills truth, O devilish-holy fray!
These vows are Hermia's: will you give her o'er?
Weigh oath with oath, and you will nothing weigh:
Your vows to her and me, put in two scales,
Will even weigh, and both as light as tales.

HELENA^
You're just getting more clever with your lies.
When one truth kills another, what a mess!
These promises were meant for Hermia, not me.
Compare your promises, and they'll weigh the same:
Both are meaningless, as light as fairy tales.

LYSANDER
I had no judgment when to her I swore.

LYSANDER^
I wasn't thinking clearly when I promised her.

HELENA
Nor none, in my mind, now you give her o'er.

HELENA^
And you're not thinking clearly now, letting her go.

LYSANDER
Demetrius loves her, and he loves not you.

LYSANDER^
Demetrius is the one who loves her, not you.

DEMETRIUS
(Awaking)
O Helena, goddess, nymph, perfect, divine!
To what, my love, shall I compare thine eyne?
Crystal is muddy. O, how ripe in show
Thy lips, those kissing cherries, tempting grow!
That pure congealed white, high Taurus snow,
Fann'd with the eastern wind, turns to a crow
When thou hold'st up thy hand: O, let me kiss
This princess of pure white, this seal of bliss!

DEMETRIUS^
(Waking up)
Oh Helena, you're like a goddess, a nymph, perfect and divine!
How can I even describe your eyes? Crystals don't compare.
Your lips are like ripe cherries, so tempting!
Even the purest snow looks dirty compared to you.
Let me kiss this epitome of purity, this symbol of happiness!

HELENA
O spite! O hell! I see you all are bent
To set against me for your merriment:
If you were civil and knew courtesy,
You would not do me thus much injury.
Can you not hate me, as I know you do,
But you must join in souls to mock me too?
If you were men, as men you are in show,
You would not use a gentle lady so;
To vow, and swear, and superpraise my parts,
When I am sure you hate me with your hearts.
You both are rivals, and love Hermia;
And now both rivals, to mock Helena:
A trim exploit, a manly enterprise,
To conjure tears up in a poor maid's eyes
With your derision! none of noble sort
Would so offend a virgin, and extort
A poor soul's patience, all to make you sport.

HELENA^
Oh, this is cruel! You're all ganging up on me for fun!
If you had any decency, you wouldn't treat me like this.
You can't just hate me, you have to mock me too?
If you were real men, you wouldn't treat a woman this way.
You make vows and compliments, but I know you hate me.
You're both in love with Hermia, and now you're mocking me.
It's a real achievement, making a girl cry for your amusement.
No one with any honor would behave like this, just for fun.

LYSANDER
You are unkind, Demetrius; be not so;
For you love Hermia; this you know I know:
And here, with all good will, with all my heart,
In Hermia's love I yield you up my part;
And yours of Helena to me bequeath,
Whom I do love and will do till my death.

LYSANDER^
Demetrius, don't be cruel; you love Hermia, and you know I know it.
So, I'm willingly giving up my claim on Hermia to you,
And you can give me your claim on Helena,
Who I truly love and will love until I die.

HELENA
Never did mockers waste more idle breath.

HELENA^
I've never heard such pointless mockery.

DEMETRIUS
Lysander, keep thy Hermia; I will none:
If e'er I loved her, all that love is gone.
My heart to her but as guest-wise sojourn'd,
And now to Helen is it home return'd,
There to remain.

DEMETRIUS^
Lysander, you can have Hermia; I don't want her anymore.
If I ever loved her, that love is gone now.
My heart was just a guest in her life,
And now it's found its home with Helena.

LYSANDER
Helen, it is not so.

LYSANDER^
Helena, that's not true.

DEMETRIUS
Disparage not the faith thou dost not know,
Lest, to thy peril, thou aby it dear.
Look, where thy love comes; yonder is thy dear.

DEMETRIUS^
Don't doubt a love you don't understand,
Or you might regret it.
Look, here comes your love; there she is.

Re-enter HERMIA

HERMIA
Dark night, that from the eye his function takes,
The ear more quick of apprehension makes;
Wherein it doth impair the seeing sense,
It pays the hearing double recompense.
Thou art not by mine eye, Lysander, found;
Mine ear, I thank it, brought me to thy sound
But why unkindly didst thou leave me so?

HERMIA^
Darkness takes away our sight but sharpens our hearing.
When we can't see, our ears work twice as hard.
I couldn't see you, Lysander, but I heard you.
Why did you leave me like that?

LYSANDER
Why should he stay, whom love doth press to go?

LYSANDER^
Why should I stay when love is pushing me to go?

HERMIA
What love could press Lysander from my side?

HERMIA^
What kind of love could push you away from me?

LYSANDER
Lysander's love, that would not let him bide,
Fair Helena, who more engilds the night
Than all you fiery oes and eyes of light.
Why seek'st thou me? could not this make thee know,
The hate I bear thee made me leave thee so?

LYSANDER^
My love for Helena, who shines brighter than any star,
Is what's pulling me away.
Why are you looking for me? Can't you see,
My feelings for you have changed, that's why I left.

HERMIA
You speak not as you think: it cannot be.

HERMIA^
You're not saying what you really feel; this can't be true.

HELENA
Lo, she is one of this confederacy!
Now I perceive they have conjoin'd all three
To fashion this false sport, in spite of me.
Injurious Hermia! most ungrateful maid!
Have you conspired, have you with these contrived
To bait me with this foul derision?
Is all the counsel that we two have shared,
The sisters' vows, the hours that we have spent,
When we have chid the hasty-footed time
For parting us,--O, is it all forgot?
All school-days' friendship, childhood innocence?
We, Hermia, like two artificial gods,
Have with our needles created both one flower,
Both on one sampler, sitting on one cushion,
Both warbling of one song, both in one key,
As if our hands, our sides, voices and minds,
Had been incorporate. So we grow together,
Like to a double cherry, seeming parted,
But yet an union in partition;
Two lovely berries moulded on one stem;
So, with two seeming bodies, but one heart;
Two of the first, like coats in heraldry,
Due but to one and crowned with one crest.
And will you rent our ancient love asunder,
To join with men in scorning your poor friend?
It is not friendly, 'tis not maidenly:
Our sex, as well as I, may chide you for it,
Though I alone do feel the injury.

HELENA^
Look, now I see you're in on this cruel joke too!
All three of you are ganging up on me.
Hermia, how could you? We've been friends for so long!
Have you plotted this just to make fun of me?
What about all the times we've shared, the secrets, the promises?
Is all of that just gone now?
We've been like sisters, doing everything together,
Singing the same songs, sharing the same dreams.
We were so close, like two cherries on the same stem.
And now you're tearing that apart, just to mock me?
That's not what friends do, that's not what women do.
I'm the one who's hurt, but you should be ashamed.

HERMIA
I am amazed at your passionate words.
I scorn you not: it seems that you scorn me.

HERMIA^
I'm shocked by what you're saying.
I'm not mocking you; it seems like you're mocking me.

HELENA
Have you not set Lysander, as in scorn,
To follow me and praise my eyes and face?
And made your other love, Demetrius,
Who even but now did spurn me with his foot,
To call me goddess, nymph, divine and rare,
Precious, celestial? Wherefore speaks he this
To her he hates? and wherefore doth Lysander
Deny your love, so rich within his soul,
And tender me, forsooth, affection,
But by your setting on, by your consent?
What thought I be not so in grace as you,
So hung upon with love, so fortunate,
But miserable most, to love unloved?
This you should pity rather than despise.

HELENA^
Did you not send Lysander to follow me and compliment me?
And get Demetrius, who just rejected me, to call me all these wonderful names?
Why would they do this unless you put them up to it?
Even if I'm not as popular or lucky in love as you,
You should feel sorry for me, not mock me.

HERMIA
I understand not what you mean by this.

HERMIA^
I don't understand what you're talking about.

HELENA
Ay, do, persever, counterfeit sad looks,
Make mouths upon me when I turn my back;
Wink each at other; hold the sweet jest up:
This sport, well carried, shall be chronicled.
If you have any pity, grace, or manners,
You would not make me such an argument.
But fare ye well: 'tis partly my own fault;
Which death or absence soon shall remedy.

HELENA^
Go ahead, keep pretending, make faces behind my back.
Wink at each other, keep the joke going.
If you had any decency, you wouldn't treat me like this.
But fine, I'll leave; some of this is my own fault,
And either death or leaving will fix it.

LYSANDER
Stay, gentle Helena; hear my excuse:
My love, my life, my soul, fair Helena!

LYSANDER^
Wait, Helena, let me explain:
You're my love, my life, my everything!

HELENA
O excellent!

HELENA^
Oh, wonderful!

HERMIA
Sweet, do not scorn her so.

HERMIA^
Hey, don't be so harsh on her.

DEMETRIUS
If she cannot entreat, I can compel.

DEMETRIUS^
If she can't persuade you, I can make you listen.

LYSANDER
Thou canst compel no more than she entreat:
Thy threats have no more strength than her weak prayers.
Helen, I love thee; by my life, I do:
I swear by that which I will lose for thee,
To prove him false that says I love thee not.

LYSANDER^
You can't force me any more than she can beg me.
Your threats are as weak as her pleas.
Helena, I love you, I swear on my life,
And I'll risk it to prove anyone wrong who says I don't.

DEMETRIUS
I say I love thee more than he can do.

DEMETRIUS^
I love you more than he ever could.

LYSANDER
If thou say so, withdraw, and prove it too.
Quick, come!

LYSANDER^
If you say so, step back and prove it.
Come on, let's go!

HERMIA
Lysander, whereto tends all this?

HERMIA^
Lysander, what's going on?

LYSANDER
Away, you Ethiope!

LYSANDER^
Get away from me!

DEMETRIUS
No, no; he'll
Seem to break loose; take on as you would follow,
But yet come not: you are a tame man, go!

DEMETRIUS^
No, he's just acting out. Pretend you'll follow him,
But don't actually go. You're too passive, just leave!

LYSANDER
Hang off, thou cat, thou burr! vile thing, let loose,
Or I will shake thee from me like a serpent!

LYSANDER^
Back off, you pest! If you don't, I'll shake you off like a snake!

HERMIA
Why are you grown so rude? what change is this?
Sweet love,--

HERMIA^
Why are you being so mean? What's gotten into you?
My love,--

LYSANDER
Thy love! out, tawny Tartar, out!
Out, loathed medicine! hated potion, hence!

LYSANDER^
Your love? Get out! You're like bad medicine!

HERMIA
Do you not jest?

HERMIA^
Are you joking?

HELENA
Yes, sooth; and so do you.

HELENA^
Yes, seriously; and so are you.

LYSANDER
Demetrius, I will keep my word with thee.

LYSANDER^
Demetrius, I'll keep my promise to you.

DEMETRIUS
I would I had your bond, for I perceive
A weak bond holds you: I'll not trust your word.

DEMETRIUS^
I wish I had something more than your word,
Because I can see it's not reliable.

LYSANDER
What, should I hurt her, strike her, kill her dead?
Although I hate her, I'll not harm her so.

LYSANDER^
Should I hurt her or even kill her?
Even if I hate her, I won't go that far.

HERMIA
What, can you do me greater harm than hate?
Hate me! wherefore? O me! what news, my love!
Am not I Hermia? are not you Lysander?
I am as fair now as I was erewhile.
Since night you loved me; yet since night you left me:
Why, then you left me--O, the gods forbid!-- In earnest, shall I say?

HERMIA^
Can you hurt me more than by hating me?
Why do you hate me? Aren't I still Hermia and you Lysander?
I'm just as beautiful as I was before.
You loved me last night, but now you've left me.
Is this for real?

LYSANDER
Ay, by my life;
And never did desire to see thee more.
Therefore be out of hope, of question, of doubt;
Be certain, nothing truer; 'tis no jest
That I do hate thee and love Helena.

LYSANDER^
Yes, I'm serious.
I never want to see you again.
I'm not joking, I hate you and love Helena now.

HERMIA
O me! you juggler! you canker-blossom!
You thief of love! what, have you come by night
And stolen my love's heart from him?

HERMIA^
You trickster! You love thief!
Did you steal his heart while I wasn't looking?

HELENA
Fine, i'faith!
Have you no modesty, no maiden shame,
No touch of bashfulness? What, will you tear
Impatient answers from my gentle tongue?
Fie, fie! you counterfeit, you puppet, you!

HELENA^
Really? Have you no shame or modesty?
Why are you forcing me to speak like this?
You're so fake, such a puppet!

HERMIA
Puppet? why so? ay, that way goes the game.
Now I perceive that she hath made compare
Between our statures; she hath urged her height;
And with her personage, her tall personage,
Her height, forsooth, she hath prevail'd with him.
And are you grown so high in his esteem;
Because I am so dwarfish and so low?
How low am I, thou painted maypole? speak;
How low am I? I am not yet so low
But that my nails can reach unto thine eyes.

HERMIA^
Puppet? Oh, I see what's going on.
You're comparing our heights, aren't you?
You think you've won him over because you're taller?
How short do you think I am?
I'm not so short that I can't scratch your eyes out.

HELENA
I pray you, though you mock me, gentlemen,
Let her not hurt me: I was never curst;
I have no gift at all in shrewishness;
I am a right maid for my cowardice:
Let her not strike me. You perhaps may think,
Because she is something lower than myself,
That I can match her.

HELENA^
Please, don't let her hurt me.
I'm not the confrontational type;
I'm too timid for that.
You might think I can take her on because I'm taller, but I can't.

HERMIA
Lower! hark, again.

HERMIA^
Lower? What are you talking about?

HELENA
Good Hermia, do not be so bitter with me.
I evermore did love you, Hermia,
Did ever keep your counsels, never wrong'd you;
Save that, in love unto Demetrius,
I told him of your stealth unto this wood.
He follow'd you; for love I follow'd him;
But he hath chid me hence and threaten'd me
To strike me, spurn me, nay, to kill me too:
And now, so you will let me quiet go,
To Athens will I bear my folly back
And follow you no further: let me go:
You see how simple and how fond I am.

HELENA^
Hermia, don't be mad at me.
I've always been your friend and never betrayed you.
Except for telling Demetrius that you ran off here.
I followed him because I love him, but he's been awful to me.
If you let me go, I'll just go back to Athens and leave you alone.
You can see how naive and foolish I am.

HERMIA
Why, get you gone: who is't that hinders you?

HERMIA^
Well, go then. What's stopping you?

HELENA
A foolish heart, that I leave here behind.

HELENA^
It's my foolish heart that I'm leaving behind.

HERMIA
What, with Lysander?

HERMIA^
You mean with Lysander?

HELENA
With Demetrius.

HELENA^
No, with Demetrius.

LYSANDER
Be not afraid; she shall not harm thee, Helena.

LYSANDER^
Don't worry, Helena. She won't hurt you.

DEMETRIUS
No, sir, she shall not, though you take her part.

DEMETRIUS^
No, she won't, even if you're on her side.

HELENA
O, when she's angry, she is keen and shrewd!
She was a vixen when she went to school;
And though she be but little, she is fierce.

HELENA^
Oh, trust me, when she's mad, she's really sharp!
She was a firecracker even in school;
She may be small, but she's fierce.

HERMIA
'Little' again! nothing but 'low' and 'little'!
Why will you suffer her to flout me thus? Let me come to her.

HERMIA^
'Little' again? Is that all you can say?
Why are you letting her mock me like this? Let me at her.

LYSANDER
Get you gone, you dwarf;
You minimus, of hindering knot-grass made; You bead, you acorn.

LYSANDER^
Go away, you little thing;
You're just a tiny obstacle, a mere speck, an acorn.

DEMETRIUS
You are too officious
In her behalf that scorns your services. Let her alone: speak not of Helena;
Take not her part; for, if thou dost intend
Never so little show of love to her, Thou shalt aby it.

DEMETRIUS^
You're too eager to help someone who doesn't want it. Leave her alone; don't talk about Helena.
Don't take her side; if you show even a little love for her, you'll regret it.

LYSANDER
Now she holds me not;
Now follow, if thou darest, to try whose right,
Of thine or mine, is most in Helena.

LYSANDER^
She's not holding me back now;
So follow me if you dare, let's see who really has Helena's heart.

DEMETRIUS
Follow! nay, I'll go with thee, cheek by jole.

Nay, go not back.

You, lady, all this mess is because of you:
Don't you dare go back now.

Nor longer stay in your curst company.
Your hands than mine are quicker for a fray,
My legs are longer though, to run away.

You might be quicker to fight,
But my legs are longer, so I'll take flight.

OBERON
This is thy negligence: still thou mistakest,
Or else committ'st thy knaveries wilfully.

OBERON^
This is your fault: you either keep messing up,
Or you're doing these tricks on purpose.

PUCK
Believe me, king of shadows, I mistook.
Did not you tell me I should know the man
By the Athenian garment he had on?
And so far blameless proves my enterprise,
That I have 'nointed an Athenian's eyes;
And so far am I glad it so did sort
As this their jangling I esteem a sport.

PUCK^
Trust me, king of shadows, I got it wrong.
Didn't you say I'd recognize the guy
By the Athenian clothes he was wearing?
So far, my mission's been without fault,
I've put the potion on an Athenian's eyes;
And I'm glad it turned out this way,
Their arguing is actually pretty entertaining.

OBERON
Thou see'st these lovers seek a place to fight:
Hie therefore, Robin, overcast the night;
The starry welkin cover thou anon
With drooping fog as black as Acheron,
And lead these testy rivals so astray
As one come not within another's way.
Like to Lysander sometime frame thy tongue,
Then stir Demetrius up with bitter wrong;
And sometime rail thou like Demetrius;
And from each other look thou lead them thus,
Till o'er their brows death-counterfeiting sleep
With leaden legs and batty wings doth creep:
Then crush this herb into Lysander's eye;
Whose liquor hath this virtuous property,
To take from thence all error with his might,
And make his eyeballs roll with wonted sight.
When they next wake, all this derision
Shall seem a dream and fruitless vision,
And back to Athens shall the lovers wend,
With league whose date till death shall never end.
Whiles I in this affair do thee employ,
I'll to my queen and beg her Indian boy;
And then I will her charmed eye release
From monster's view, and all things shall be peace.

OBERON^
You see these lovers are looking for a place to fight.
So go, Robin, make the night dark;
Cover the starry sky with a fog as black as death,
And lead these angry rivals so far astray
That they don't cross each other's paths.
Sometimes talk like Lysander to provoke Demetrius;
And sometimes talk like Demetrius to provoke Lysander;
Lead them away from each other like this,
Until they fall into a sleep so deep it's like death.
Then put this herb into Lysander's eyes;
Its juice has the power to remove all mistakes,
And make him see as he used to.
When they wake up, all this confusion
Will seem like a pointless dream,
And they'll go back to Athens, their love as strong as ever.
While you're doing this, I'll go to my queen and ask for her Indian boy;
Then I'll free her from the monster's spell, and everything will be peaceful.

PUCK
My fairy lord, this must be done with haste,
For night's swift dragons cut the clouds full fast,
And yonder shines Aurora's harbinger;
At whose approach, ghosts, wandering here and there,
Troop home to churchyards: damned spirits all,
That in crossways and floods have burial,
Already to their wormy beds are gone;
For fear lest day should look their shames upon,
They willfully themselves exile from light
And must for aye consort with black-brow'd night.

PUCK^
My lord, we need to hurry,
For the night is quickly passing,
And the dawn is almost here.
When it arrives, all the wandering ghosts
Return to their graves: all the damned spirits,
Who are buried in crossroads and rivers,
Have already gone to their wormy beds;
Afraid that the daylight will expose them,
They willingly exile themselves from the light
And must forever stay with the dark night.

OBERON
But we are spirits of another sort:
I with the morning's love have oft made sport,
And, like a forester, the groves may tread,
Even till the eastern gate, all fiery-red,
Opening on Neptune with fair blessed beams,
Turns into yellow gold his salt green streams.
But, notwithstanding, haste; make no delay:
We may effect this business yet ere day.

OBERON^
But we're different kinds of spirits:
I often play with the morning light,
And I can roam the forests
Until the eastern sky turns red,
And the sun's rays turn the ocean's green waves to gold.
But still, hurry; don't delay:
We can still get this done before daybreak.

Exit.

PUCK
Up and down, up and down,
I will lead them up and down:
I am fear'd in field and town:
Goblin, lead them up and down.
Here comes one.

PUCK^
Up and down, up and down,
I'll lead them on a merry chase:
I'm feared both in the field and in the town:
Hey Goblin, let's mess with them.

Speak! Are you hiding in a bush? Where are you?

PUCK
Thou coward, art thou bragging to the stars,
Telling the bushes that thou look'st for wars,
And wilt not come? Come, recreant; come, thou child;
I'll whip thee with a rod: he is defiled
That draws a sword on thee.

PUCK^
You coward, are you boasting to the sky,
Telling the bushes you're looking for a fight,
But you won't show up? Come on, you wimp;
I'll whip you: anyone who draws a sword on you is a disgrace.

And here will rest me.
(Lies down)
Come, thou gentle day!
For if but once thou show me thy grey light,
I'll find Demetrius and revenge this spite.

LYSANDER^
He keeps leading me on, but when I get there, he's gone.
He's way faster than me:
I followed quickly, but he flew even faster;
Now I'm lost in this dark, uneven path,
So I'll rest here.

If you show up even once, I'll find Demetrius and get my revenge.

Abide me, if thou darest; for well I wot
Thou runn'st before me, shifting every place,
And darest not stand, nor look me in the face.
Where art thou now?

Wait for me if you dare; I know you're running away,
Changing locations, and you don't have the guts to face me.
Where are you now?

Come hither: I am here.

PUCK^
Come here: I'm right here.

DEMETRIUS
Nay, then, thou mock'st me. Thou shalt buy this dear,
If ever I thy face by daylight see:
Now, go thy way. Faintness constraineth me
To measure out my length on this cold bed.
By day's approach look to be visited.

DEMETRIUS^
Alright, you're making fun of me. You'll pay for this,
If I ever see your face in daylight:
Now, I'm leaving. I'm too tired to keep this up,

Expect a visit when the day comes.

Abate thy hour! Shine comforts from the east,

Steal me awhile from mine own company.

Oh, what a long, exhausting night,
Hurry up, dawn! Bring some light,
So I can go back to Athens, away from those who hate me,
And let sleep take me away from my own misery.

Heavens shield Lysander, if they mean a fray!


HERMIA^
I've never been this tired or this upset,
Soaked with dew and scratched by thorns,

Of thy former lady's eye:

That every man should take his own,
In your waking shall be shown:
Jack shall have Jill;
Nought shall go ill;
The man shall have his mare again, and all shall be well.

Enter PUCK

OBERON
Welcome, good Robin.
See'st thou this sweet sight?
Her dotage now I do begin to pity:
For, meeting her of late behind the wood,
Seeking sweet favours from this hateful fool,
I did upbraid her and fall out with her;
For she his hairy temples then had rounded
With a coronet of fresh and fragrant flowers;
And that same dew, which sometime on the buds
Was wont to swell like round and orient pearls,
Stood now within the pretty flowerets' eyes
Like tears that did their own disgrace bewail.
When I had at my pleasure taunted her
And she in mild terms begg'd my patience,
I then did ask of her her changeling child;
Which straight she gave me, and her fairy sent
To bear him to my bower in fairy land.
And now I have the boy, I will undo
This hateful imperfection of her eyes:
And, gentle Puck, take this transformed scalp
From off the head of this Athenian swain;
That, he awaking when the other do,
May all to Athens back again repair
And think no more of this night's accidents
But as the fierce vexation of a dream.
But first I will release the fairy queen.
Be as thou wast wont to be;
See as thou wast wont to see:
Dian's bud o'er Cupid's flower
Hath such force and blessed power.
Now, my Titania; wake you, my sweet queen.

OBERON^
Hey Robin, welcome.
You see this? I'm starting to feel bad for her.
She was behind the woods recently, trying to get love from this idiot.
I confronted her and argued with her;
She had even decorated his hairy forehead
With a crown of fresh and sweet-smelling flowers.
And the dew that used to make buds swell
Like shiny, round pearls,
Now looked like tears in the eyes of those little flowers,
Tears that seemed to lament their own shame.
After I had mocked her to my heart's content
And she had politely asked me to stop,
I then asked her for her changeling child;
She immediately gave him to me and sent a fairy
To take him to my home in fairyland.
Now that I have the boy, I'll fix
This awful spell on her eyes.
And Puck, remove this enchanted hair
From this Athenian guy's head;
So that when he wakes up, he can go back to Athens
And think of tonight's events
As nothing more than a bad dream.
But first, I'll free the fairy queen.
Be yourself again;
See as you used to see:
The power of Dian's bud over Cupid's flower
Is strong and blessed.
Now wake up, my sweet queen Titania.

TITANIA
My Oberon! what visions have I seen!
Methought I was enamour'd of an ass.

TITANIA^
Oberon, what crazy dreams I've had! I thought I was in love with a donkey!

OBERON
There lies your love.

OBERON^
Well, there's the one you were in love with.

TITANIA
How came these things to pass?
O, how mine eyes do loathe his visage now!

TITANIA^
How did this even happen?
Ugh, I can't stand the sight of him now!

OBERON
Silence awhile. Robin, take off this head.
Titania, music call; and strike more dead
Than common sleep of all these five the sense.

Hold on a sec. Robin, remove that head.
Titania, call for some music; let it put them into a deeper sleep than usual.

Now, when thou wakest, with thine
own fool's eyes peep.

PUCK^
Now, when you wake up, you'll see with your own foolish eyes.

OBERON
Sound, music! Come, my queen, take hands with me,
And rock the ground whereon these sleepers be.
Now thou and I are new in amity,
And will to-morrow midnight solemnly
Dance in Duke Theseus' house triumphantly,
And bless it to all fair prosperity:
There shall the pairs of faithful lovers be
Wedded, with Theseus, all in jollity.

OBERON^
Play the music! Come, my queen, join hands with me,
And let's dance around these sleeping people.
We're friends again,
And tomorrow night we'll dance in Duke Theseus' house,
Celebrating and blessing it for good luck.
There, all the loving couples will get married,
And we'll all celebrate with Theseus.

PUCK
Fairy king, attend, and mark:
I do hear the morning lark.

PUCK^
Fairy king, listen up:
I hear the morning bird singing.

Then, my queen, in silence sad,
Trip we after the night's shade:
We the globe can compass soon,
Swifter than the wandering moon.

OBERON^
Then, my queen, let's quietly go,
Following the night's shadow.
We can travel around the world quickly,
Faster than the moon moves.

Come, my lord, and in our flight
Tell me how it came this night
That I sleeping here was found
With these mortals on the ground.

Come, my lord, and while we fly,
Tell me how it happened that I
Was found sleeping here
With these humans around me.

For now our observation is perform'd;
And since we have the vaward of the day,
My love shall hear the music of my hounds.
Uncouple in the western valley; let them go:
Dispatch, I say, and find the forester.

We will, fair queen, up to the mountain's top,
And mark the musical confusion
Of hounds and echo in conjunction.

Someone go find the forest ranger;
We've finished our observation for now.
Since we're ahead of schedule,
My love will get to hear the music of my hunting dogs.
Release them in the western valley; let them go.
Hurry up, I said, and find the forest ranger.
(An Attendant leaves)
We'll go, my queen, up to the top of the mountain,
And listen to the beautiful chaos
Of the hounds and the echoes mixing together.

HIPPOLYTA
I was with Hercules and Cadmus once,
When in a wood of Crete they bay'd the bear
With hounds of Sparta: never did I hear
Such gallant chiding: for, besides the groves,
The skies, the fountains, every region near
Seem'd all one mutual cry: I never heard
So musical a discord, such sweet thunder.

HIPPOLYTA^
I was once with Hercules and Cadmus,
Hunting a bear in a Cretan forest with Spartan hounds.
I've never heard such magnificent barking;
It wasn't just the woods, but the sky, the water,
Everything around us seemed to join in the noise.
I've never heard such a musical chaos, such beautiful noise.

THESEUS
My hounds are bred out of the Spartan kind,
So flew'd, so sanded, and their heads are hung
With ears that sweep away the morning dew;
Crook-knee'd, and dew-lapp'd like Thessalian bulls;
Slow in pursuit, but match'd in mouth like bells,
Each under each. A cry more tuneable
Was never holla'd to, nor cheer'd with horn,
In Crete, in Sparta, nor in Thessaly:
Judge when you hear. But, soft! what nymphs are these?

THESEUS^
My dogs are of Spartan breed,
With droopy, sandy-colored fur and long ears
That brush away the morning dew.
They have bent knees and loose skin like Thessalian bulls;
They're slow to chase, but their barks harmonize like bells.
You won't hear a more melodious sound,
Not in Crete, Sparta, or Thessaly.
You'll see what I mean. But wait, who are these women?

EGEUS
My lord, this is my daughter here asleep;
And this, Lysander; this Demetrius is;
This Helena, old Nedar's Helena:
I wonder of their being here together.

EGEUS^
My lord, this is my daughter sleeping here;
And this is Lysander; this one's Demetrius;
And this is Helena, old Nedar's daughter:
I'm surprised they're all here together.

THESEUS
No doubt they rose up early to observe
The rite of May, and hearing our intent,
Came here in grace our solemnity.
But speak, Egeus; is not this the day
That Hermia should give answer of her choice?

THESEUS^
They probably woke up early for the May Day celebration,
And knowing what we planned, came here to join us.
But Egeus, isn't today the day

Sorry, sir.

I pray you all, stand up. I know you two are rival enemies: How comes this gentle concord in the world, That hatred is so far from jealousy, To sleep by hate, and fear no enmity?

THESEUS^
Everyone, please stand. How is it that you two, who are supposed to be enemies, are here together? How can you be so close yet not be jealous of each other, to the point where you can sleep next to each other without fear?

LYSANDER
My lord, I shall reply amazedly, Half sleep, half waking: but as yet, I swear, I cannot truly say how I came here; But, as I think,--for truly would I speak, And now do I bethink me, so it is,-- I came with Hermia hither: our intent Was to be gone from Athens, where we might, Without the peril of the Athenian law.

LYSANDER^
Sir, I'm honestly confused. I'm half asleep and half awake. I can't really say how I got here. But I think I came here with Hermia. We were planning to leave Athens to avoid breaking any laws.

EGEUS
Enough, enough, my lord; you have enough: I beg the law, the law, upon his head. They would have stolen away; they would, Demetrius, Thereby to have defeated you and me, You of your wife and me of my consent, Of my consent that she should be your wife.

EGEUS^
That's enough, my lord. I demand that the law be enforced on him. They were planning to run away, Demetrius, and in doing so, they would have cheated both of us. You would have lost your future wife, and I would have lost my say in who she marries.


DEMETRIUS
My lord, fair Helen told me of their stealth, Of this their purpose hither to this wood; And I in fury hither follow'd them, Fair Helena in fancy following me. But, my good lord, I wot not by what power,-- But by some power it is,--my love to Hermia, Melted as the snow, seems to me now As the remembrance of an idle gaud Which in my childhood I did dote upon; And all the faith, the virtue of my heart, The object and the pleasure of mine eye, Is only Helena. To her, my lord, Was I betroth'd ere I saw Hermia: But, like in sickness, did I loathe this food; But, as in health, come to my natural taste, Now I do wish it, love it, long for it, And will for evermore be true to it.

DEMETRIUS^
Sir, Helena told me that Hermia and Lysander were planning to run away to this forest, so I followed them here, with Helena following me. I don't know how it happened, but my feelings for Hermia have completely changed. She's like a childhood toy that I've outgrown. Now, all I care about is Helena. I was actually engaged to her before I ever met Hermia. I used to find her unattractive, like food that makes you sick, but now she's all I want, and I'll be true to her forever.


THESEUS
Fair lovers, you are fortunately met: Of this discourse we more will hear anon. Egeus, I will overbear your will; For in the temple by and by with us These couples shall eternally be knit: And, for the morning now is something worn, Our purposed hunting shall be set aside. Away with us to Athens; three and three, We'll hold a feast in great solemnity. Come, Hippolyta.

THESEUS^
Lucky for you all that we met like this. We'll discuss this more later. Egeus, I'm going to overrule you. These couples will be married in the temple soon. Since the morning is already getting late, we'll cancel our planned hunting trip. Let's all go back to Athens, and we'll have a grand celebration. Come on, Hippolyta.

Are we sure we're awake? It feels like we're still dreaming. Didn't the duke just tell us to follow him?

HERMIA
Yea; and my father.

HERMIA^
Yes, and so did my dad.

HELENA
And Hippolyta.

HELENA^
And Hippolyta too.

LYSANDER
And he did bid us follow to the temple.

LYSANDER^
He told us to go to the temple.

DEMETRIUS
Why, then, we are awake: let's follow him And by the way let us recount our dreams.

DEMETRIUS^
Well, if that's the case, we must be awake. Let's follow him and talk about our dreams along the way.


Exeunt.

EXT. SAME PART OF THE WOOD - CONTINUOUS

BOTTOM
(Awaking) 
When my cue comes, call me, and I will answer: my next is, 'Most fair Pyramus.' Heigh-ho! Peter Quince! Flute, the bellows-mender! Snout, the tinker! Starveling! God's my life, stolen hence, and left me asleep! I have had a most rare vision. I have had a dream, past the wit of man to say what dream it was: man is but an ass, if he go about to expound this dream. Methought I was--there is no man can tell what. Methought I was,--and methought I had,--but man is but a patched fool, if he will offer to say what methought I had. The eye of man hath not heard, the ear of man hath not seen, man's hand is not able to taste, his tongue to conceive, nor his heart to report, what my dream was. I will get Peter Quince to write a ballad of this dream: it shall be called Bottom's Dream, because it hath no bottom; and I will sing it in the latter end of a play, before the duke: peradventure, to make it the more gracious, I shall sing it at her death.

BOTTOM^
(Waking up) 
When it's my turn, call me, and I'll come out: my next line is, 'Most fair Pyramus.' Hey there! Peter Quince! Flute, the repair guy! Snout, the handyman! Starveling! Oh my God, they've all left and let me sleep! I just had the craziest dream. It's beyond words, really. Trying to explain it would make anyone look like a fool. I thought I was—well, it's indescribable. No one could even begin to understand what I thought I was or had. It's beyond human senses to grasp. I'll get Peter Quince to write a song about this dream. I'll call it 'Bottom's Dream' because it's bottomless. I'll perform it at the end of a play, in front of the duke. Maybe to make it more dramatic, I'll sing it as a farewell song.


INT. ATHENS - QUINCE'S HOUSE - Day

Enter QUINCE, FLUTE, SNOUT, and STARVELING

QUINCE
Have you sent to Bottom's house? Is he come home yet?

QUINCE^
Did anyone check Bottom's house? Is he back yet?

STARVELING
He cannot be heard of. Out of doubt he is transported.

STARVELING^
No one's heard from him. He must be gone for sure.

FLUTE
If he come not, then the play is marred: it goes not forward, doth it?

FLUTE^
If he doesn't show up, the play is ruined, right? We can't go on without him?

QUINCE
It is not possible: you have not a man in all Athens able to discharge Pyramus but he.

QUINCE^
It's impossible. There's no one else in Athens who can play Pyramus like he can.

FLUTE
No, he hath simply the best wit of any handicraft man in Athens.

FLUTE^
Exactly, he's the smartest craftsman in Athens.

QUINCE
Yea and the best person too; and he is a very paramour for a sweet voice.

QUINCE^
And he's also the best actor; he's perfect for the role because of his great voice.

FLUTE
You must say 'paragon:' a paramour is, God bless us, a thing of naught.

FLUTE^
You mean 'paragon.' 'Paramour' is something entirely different, trust me.

Enter SNUG

SNUG
Masters, the duke is coming from the temple, and there is two or three lords and ladies more married: if our sport had gone forward, we had all been made men.

SNUG^
Guys, the duke is coming back from the temple, and a few more lords and ladies got married too. If our play had happened, we would've all been set.

FLUTE
O sweet bully Bottom! Thus hath he lost sixpence a day during his life; he could not have 'scaped sixpence a day: an the duke had not given him sixpence a day for playing Pyramus, I'll be hanged; he would have deserved it: sixpence a day in Pyramus, or nothing.

FLUTE^
Oh man, poor Bottom! He's missing out on earning a little extra money. If the duke hadn't planned to pay him for playing Pyramus, I'd be shocked. He totally would've earned it. It's either that role or nothing for him.

Enter BOTTOM

BOTTOM
Where are these lads? Where are these hearts?

BOTTOM^
Where is everyone? Where are my guys?

QUINCE
Bottom! O most courageous day! O most happy hour!

QUINCE^
Bottom! What a great day! What a fantastic moment!

BOTTOM
Masters, I am to discourse what; for if I tell you, I will tell you every thing,

BOTTOM^
Guys, I have some news to share, and if I start, I'll tell you everything,

QUINCE
Let us hear, sweet Bottom.

QUINCE^
Let's hear it, dear Bottom.

BOTTOM
Not a word of me. All that I will tell you is, that the duke hath dined. Get your apparel together, good strings to your beards, new ribbons to your pumps; meet presently at the palace; every man look o'er his part; for the short and the long is, our play is preferred. In any case, let Thisby have clean linen; and let not him that plays the lion pair his nails, for they shall hang out for the lion's claws. And, most dear actors, eat no onions nor garlic, for we are to utter sweet breath; and I do not doubt but to hear them say, it is a sweet comedy. No more words: away! go, away!

BOTTOM^
I won't go into details. All you need to know is that the duke has had his meal. So get your costumes ready, fix your fake beards, and put new ribbons on your shoes. Meet at the palace ASAP. Everyone, review your lines because our play has been chosen. Make sure Thisby has clean clothes, and whoever is playing the lion shouldn't trim their nails — they'll act as the lion's claws. And guys, don't eat onions or garlic; we need to have fresh breath. I'm sure they'll say our play is delightful. Enough talking: let's go, go, go!

INT. ATHENS - The palace of theseus - day

HIPPOLYTA
'Tis strange my Theseus, that these lovers speak of.

HIPPOLYTA^
It's really strange, Theseus, what these lovers are talking about.

THESEUS
More strange than true: I never may believe These antique fables, nor these fairy toys. Lovers and madmen have such seething brains, Such shaping fantasies, that apprehend More than cool reason ever comprehends. The lunatic, the lover and the poet Are of imagination all compact: One sees more devils than vast hell can hold, That is, the madman: the lover, all as frantic, Sees Helen's beauty in a brow of Egypt: The poet's eye, in fine frenzy rolling, Doth glance from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven; And as imagination bodies forth The forms of things unknown, the poet's pen Turns them to shapes and gives to airy nothing A local habitation and a name. Such tricks hath strong imagination, That if it would but apprehend some joy, It comprehends some bringer of that joy; Or in the night, imagining some fear, How easy is a bush supposed a bear!

THESEUS^
It's more bizarre than believable. I can't take these old stories and fairy tales seriously. Lovers and madmen, they have such wild imaginations that they see things reason can't even grasp. The crazy person, the lover, and the poet are all driven by imagination. The madman sees more demons than hell could possibly hold. The lover, just as crazy, sees ideal beauty in the most ordinary face. The poet, with his wild imagination, looks from heaven to earth and back again, turning the unknown into something tangible. Imagination is so powerful that it can make us see joy or fear where there's none—like mistaking a bush for a bear in the dark.

HIPPOLYTA
But all the story of the night told over, And all their minds transfigured so together, More witnesseth than fancy's images And grows to something of great constancy; But, howsoever, strange and admirable.

HIPPOLYTA^
But when you consider everything that happened last night, and how it's changed them all, it's more than just imagination. It's turned into something real and lasting, even if it's strange and incredible.

THESEUS
Here come the lovers, full of joy and mirth. Joy, gentle friends! joy and fresh days of love Accompany your hearts!

THESEUS^
Here come the happy couples, full of joy and cheer. May your lives be filled with love and happiness!

LYSANDER
More than to us Wait in your royal walks, your board, your bed!

LYSANDER^
May you find even more joy in your royal duties, meals, and rest than we do!

THESEUS
Come now; what masques, what dances shall we have, To wear away this long age of three hours Between our after-supper and bed-time? Where is our usual manager of mirth? What revels are in hand? Is there no play, To ease the anguish of a torturing hour?

THESEUS^
So what's the plan for entertainment tonight? How are we going to pass these next few hours before bedtime? Where's our entertainment coordinator? What festivities do we have lined up? Is there a play or something to make the time go by faster?

PHILOSTRATE
Here, mighty Theseus.

PHILOSTRATE^
I'm here, Your Highness.

THESEUS
Say, what abridgement have you for this evening? What masque? What music? How shall we beguile The lazy time, if not with some delight?

THESEUS^
So, what's on the agenda for tonight? Any performances or music? How are we going to make this evening enjoyable?

PHILOSTRATE
There is a brief how many sports are ripe: Make choice of which your highness will see first.

PHILOSTRATE^
I have a list of available entertainments. You can pick which one you'd like to see first.

THESEUS
‘The battle with the Centaurs, to be sung
By an Athenian eunuch to the harp.'
We'll none of that: that have I told my love,
In glory of my kinsman Hercules.

THESEUS^
A song about the Centaur battle, played by an Athenian eunuch? Nah, I've already told that story to my love, to honor my relative Hercules.

THESEUS
'The riot of the tipsy Bacchanals,
Tearing the Thracian singer in their rage.'
That is an old device; and it was play'd
When I from Thebes came last a conqueror.

THESEUS^
A drama about drunk revelers tearing apart a Thracian singer? That's old news; they performed that when I last returned victorious from Thebes.

THESEUS
'The thrice three Muses mourning for the death
Of Learning, late deceased in beggary.'
That is some satire, keen and critical,
Not sorting with a nuptial ceremony.

THESEUS^
A play about the Muses mourning the death of Learning, who died poor? That's some sharp satire, not really fitting for a wedding.

THESEUS
'A tedious brief scene of young Pyramus
And his love Thisbe; very tragical mirth.'
Merry and tragical! tedious and brief!
That is, hot ice and wondrous strange snow.
How shall we find the concord of this discord?

THESEUS^
A short yet long-winded play about Pyramus and Thisbe, full of tragic humor? It's like saying hot ice and weird snow. How do we make sense of these contradictions?

PHILOSTRATE
A play there is, my lord, some ten words long,
Which is as brief as I have known a play;
But by ten words, my lord, it is too long,
Which makes it tedious; for in all the play
There is not one word apt, one player fitted:
And tragical, my noble lord, it is;
For Pyramus therein doth kill himself.
Which, when I saw rehearsed, I must confess,
Made mine eyes water; but more merry tears
The passion of loud laughter never shed.

PHILOSTRATE^
My lord, there's a play that's only about ten words long, which is the shortest I've ever seen. But even at ten words, it's too long and boring. None of the words fit, and none of the actors are right for their roles. It's a tragedy; Pyramus kills himself in it. I have to admit, it made me cry when I saw it rehearsed, but they were tears of laughter.

THESEUS
What are they that do play it?

THESEUS^
Who are the actors performing this play?

PHILOSTRATE
Hard-handed men that work in Athens here,
Which never labour'd in their minds till now,
And now have toil'd their unbreathed memories
With this same play, against your nuptial.

PHILOSTRATE^
The actors are hardworking men from Athens who've never really used their brains for something like this before. They've really strained their memories to prepare this play for your wedding.

THESEUS
And we will hear it.

THESEUS^
We'll listen to it then.

PHILOSTRATE
No, my noble lord;
It is not for you: I have heard it over,
And it is nothing, nothing in the world;
Unless you can find sport in their intents,
Extremely stretch'd and conn'd with cruel pain,
To do you service.

PHILOSTRATE^
Honestly, my lord, it's not worth your time. I've heard it, and it's really nothing special. Unless you find amusement in their earnest but painfully awkward efforts to please you.

THESEUS
I will hear that play;
For never anything can be amiss,
When simpleness and duty tender it.
Go, bring them in: and take your places, ladies.

THESEUS^
I still want to hear it. Nothing can go wrong when the intent is pure and dutiful. Go ahead, bring them in, and let's all take our seats.

I love not to see wretchedness o'er charged
And duty in his service perishing.

HIPPOLYTA^
I don't like seeing people overwhelmed and their efforts going to waste.

THESEUS
Why, gentle sweet, you shall see no such thing.

THESEUS^
Don't worry, my love, you won't see anything like that.

HIPPOLYTA
He says they can do nothing in this kind.

HIPPOLYTA^
He's saying they're not capable of performing well.

THESEUS
The kinder we, to give them thanks for nothing.
Our sport shall be to take what they mistake:
And what poor duty cannot do, noble respect
Takes it in might, not merit.
Where I have come, great clerks have purposed
To greet me with premeditated welcomes;
Where I have seen them shiver and look pale,
Make periods in the midst of sentences,
Throttle their practised accent in their fears
And in conclusion dumbly have broke off,
Not paying me a welcome.
Trust me, sweet, Out of this silence yet I pick'd a welcome;
And in the modesty of fearful duty
I read as much as from the rattling tongue
Of saucy and audacious eloquence.
Love, therefore, and tongue-tied simplicity
In least speak most, to my capacity.

THESEUS^
We should be kind enough to appreciate their efforts, even if they mess up. Sometimes it's the thought that counts, not the execution. I've been welcomed by great scholars who were so nervous they couldn't even finish their sentences. Yet, I still felt welcomed. Sometimes, simple and sincere gestures speak louder than the most eloquent words.

PROLOGUE
If we offend, it is with our good will.
That you should think, we come not to offend,
But with good will. To show our simple skill,
That is the true beginning of our end.
Consider then we come but in despite.
We do not come as minding to contest you,
Our true intent is. All for your delight
We are not here. That you should here repent you,
The actors are at hand and by their show
You shall know all that you are like to know.

PROLOGUE^
If we mess up, know that we mean well. We're not here to offend you, but to entertain you. So, don't take us too seriously. The actors are ready, and through their performance, you'll learn all you need to know.

THESEUS
This fellow doth not stand upon points.

THESEUS^
This guy isn't too concerned with details.

LYSANDER
He hath rid his prologue like a rough colt; he knows
not the stop. A good moral, my lord: it is not enough to speak, but to speak true.

LYSANDER^
He delivered his prologue like a wild horse; he doesn't know when to stop. The lesson here, my lord, is that it's not just about speaking; it's about speaking truthfully.

HIPPOLYTA
Indeed he hath played on his prologue like a child
on a recorder; a sound, but not in government.

HIPPOLYTA^
He performed his prologue like a child playing a recorder; there's sound, but no control.

Enter Pyramus and Thisbe, Wall, Moonshine, and Lion

PROLOGUE
Gentles, perchance you wonder at this show;
But wonder on, till truth make all things plain.
This man is Pyramus, if you would know;
This beauteous lady Thisby is certain.
This man, with lime and rough-cast, doth present
Wall, that vile Wall which did these lovers sunder;
And through Wall's crack, poor souls, they are content
To whisper. At the which let no man wonder.
This man, with lanthorn, dog, and bush of thorn,
Presenteth Moonshine; for, if you will know,
By moonshine did these lovers think no scorn
To meet at Ninus' tomb, there, there to woo.
This grisly beast, which Lion hight by name,
The trusty Thisby, coming first by night,
Did scare away, or rather did affright;
And, as she fled, her mantle she did fall,
Which Lion vile with bloody mouth did stain.
Anon comes Pyramus, sweet youth and tall,
And finds his trusty Thisby's mantle slain:
Whereat, with blade, with bloody blameful blade,
He bravely broach'd is boiling bloody breast;
And Thisby, tarrying in mulberry shade,
His dagger drew, and died. For all the rest,
Let Lion, Moonshine, Wall, and lovers twain
At large discourse, while here they do remain.

PROLOGUE^
Ladies and gentlemen, you might be wondering what's going on. Just keep watching, and it'll all make sense. This guy is Pyramus, and this lovely lady is Thisbe. The man with the plaster is the Wall that separated them. They whisper through a crack in the Wall. The guy with the lantern, dog, and thorn bush is Moonshine. These lovers met under the moonlight at Ninus' tomb. The scary creature is Lion, who scared Thisbe and stained her cloak with blood. Then Pyramus finds the cloak and kills himself. Thisbe also takes her life. Now, let's let the characters tell the story.

Exeunt Prologue, Thisbe, Lion, and Moonshine

INT. ATHENS - THE PALACE OF THESEUS - DAY - CONTINUOUS

THESEUS
I wonder if the lion be to speak.

THESEUS^
I wonder if the lion is going to talk.

DEMETRIUS
No wonder, my lord: one lion may, when many asses do.

DEMETRIUS^
It wouldn't be surprising, my lord. If so many fools can talk, why not a lion?

WALL
In this same interlude it doth befall
That I, one Snout by name, present a wall;
And such a wall, as I would have you think,
That had in it a crannied hole or slit,
Through which the lovers, Pyramus and Thisby,
Did whisper often very secretly.
This loam, this rough-cast and this stone doth show
That I am that same wall; the truth is so:
And this the cranny is, right and sinister,
Through which the fearful lovers are to whisper.

WALL^
In this part of the play, I'm Snout, and I'm playing the role of a wall. Imagine a wall with a small crack, through which Pyramus and Thisbe whispered to each other. This plaster and stone show that I am that wall, and here's the crack they whispered through.

THESEUS
Would you desire lime and hair to speak better?

THESEUS^
Do you think adding more details would make the wall more convincing?

DEMETRIUS
It is the wittiest partition that ever I heard
discourse, my lord.

This is the most clever wall I've ever heard, my lord.

O night, which ever art when day is not!
O night, O night! alack, alack, alack,
I fear my Thisby's promise is forgot!
And thou, O wall, O sweet, O lovely wall,
That stand'st between her father's ground and mine!
Thou wall, O wall, O sweet and lovely wall,
Show me thy slit, to blink through with mine eyne!
Thanks, courteous wall: Jove shield thee well for this!
But what see I? No Thisby do I see.
O wicked wall, through whom I see no bliss!
Cursed be thy stones for thus deceiving me!

PYRAMUS^
Oh, dark and dreadful night! Where is the day? Oh, night! I'm afraid Thisby has forgotten her promise. And you, wall, you lovely wall that separates me from Thisby, show me the crack so I can peek through! - Thank you, kind wall. But wait, where's Thisby? Oh, you deceitful wall, you've tricked me!

THESEUS
The wall, methinks, being sensible, should curse again.

THESEUS^
I think the wall, if it could feel, should curse back.

PYRAMUS
No, in truth, sir, he should not. 'Deceiving me'
is Thisby's cue: she is to enter now, and I am to spy her through the wall.
You shall see, it will fall pat as I told you. Yonder she comes.

PYRAMUS^
Actually, sir, the wall shouldn't curse. Thisby is supposed to come in now; that's her cue. Just watch, it'll happen just like I said. Here she comes.

Oh wall, you've heard my cries so many times,
For keeping me apart from my dear Pyramus!
I've even kissed your stones,
Stones made of lime and hair.

I see a voice: now will I to the slit,
To spy an I can hear my Thisby's face.

I hear a voice: I'll peek through the crack,
To see if it's my Thisby's face.

My love thou art, my love I think.

Think what thou wilt, I am thy lover's grace;
And, like Limander, am I trusty still.

Think what you want, I'm your faithful lover;
Just like Limander, I'm always true.

And I like Helen, till the Fates me kill.

LION
You, ladies, you, whose gentle hearts do fear
The smallest monstrous mouse that creeps on floor,
May now perchance both quake and tremble here,
When lion rough in wildest rage doth roar.
Then know that I, one Snug the joiner, am
A lion-fell, nor else no lion's dam;
For, if I should as lion come in strife
Into this place, 'twere pity on my life.

LION^
Ladies, if you're scared of even a tiny mouse,
You might just shake and shiver now,
As I, a lion, roar in my wildest rage.
But know that I'm just Snug the carpenter,
Not a real lion; otherwise, it'd be bad for me.

THESEUS
A very gentle beast, of a good conscience.

THESEUS^
What a gentle beast, and so well-behaved.

DEMETRIUS
The very best at a beast, my lord, that e'er I saw.

DEMETRIUS^
The best portrayal of a beast I've ever seen, my lord.

LYSANDER
This lion is a very fox for his valour.

LYSANDER^
This lion is as brave as a fox.

THESEUS
True; and a goose for his discretion.

THESEUS^
True, and as wise as a goose.

DEMETRIUS
Not so, my lord; for his valour cannot carry his
discretion; and the fox carries the goose.

DEMETRIUS^
That's not the case, my lord; his bravery can't make up for his lack of wisdom; just like the fox carries off the goose.

THESEUS
His discretion, I am sure, cannot carry his valour;
for the goose carries not the fox. It is well:
leave it to his discretion, and let us listen to the moon.

THESEUS^
I'm sure his wisdom can't make up for his bravery; because the goose doesn't carry off the fox. Let's leave it to his judgment and listen to the moon.

MOONSHINE
This lanthorn doth the horned moon present;--

MOONSHINE^
This lantern represents the horned moon.

DEMETRIUS
He should have worn the horns on his head.

DEMETRIUS^
He should've put the horns on his head.

THESEUS
He is no crescent, and his horns are
invisible within the circumference.

THESEUS^
He's not a crescent moon, so you can't see his horns.

MOONSHINE
This lanthorn doth the horned moon present;
Myself the man i' the moon do seem to be.

MOONSHINE^
This lantern represents the horned moon;
I'm supposed to be the man in the moon.

THESEUS
This is the greatest error of all the rest: the man
should be put into the lanthorn. How is it else the man i' the moon?

THESEUS^
That's the biggest mistake of all: the man should be inside the lantern. How else could he be the man in the moon?

DEMETRIUS
He dares not come there for the candle; for, you
see, it is already in snuff.

DEMETRIUS^
He won't come near the candle; it's already burnt out.

HIPPOLYTA
I am aweary of this moon: would he would change!

HIPPOLYTA^
I'm tired of this moon; I wish he'd switch it up.

THESEUS
It appears, by his small light of discretion, that
he is in the wane; but yet, in courtesy, in all reason, we must stay the time.
Proceed, Moon.

THESEUS^
It seems, by his lack of good judgment, that he's fading. But we should be polite and wait. Go on, Moon.

MOONSHINE
All that I have to say, is, to tell you that the
lanthorn is the moon; I, the man in the moon; this thorn-bush, my thorn-bush; and this dog, my dog.

MOONSHINE^
All I have to say is that the lantern is the moon; I'm the man in the moon; this thorn-bush is mine; and this dog is my dog.

DEMETRIUS
Why, all these should be in the lanthorn; for all
these are in the moon. But, silence! here comes Thisbe.

DEMETRIUS^
Well, all of these should be in the lantern; they're all part of the moon. But quiet, here comes Thisbe.

INT. ATHENS - THE PALACE OF THESEUS - DAY - CONTINUOUS

Enter Thisbe

THISBE
This is old Ninny's tomb. Where is my love?
Oh - 

THISBE^
This is old Ninny's grave. Where's my love?
Oh -

LION
(Roaring)

LION^
(Roaring)

DEMETRIUS
Well roared, Lion.

DEMETRIUS^
Nice roar, Lion.

THESEUS
Well run, Thisbe.

THESEUS^
Good job running, Thisbe.

HIPPOLYTA
Well shone, Moon. Truly, the moon shines with a
good grace.

HIPPOLYTA^
Nice glow, Moon. The moon really does shine nicely.

The Lion shakes Thisbe's cloak and leaves.

THESEUS
Well moused, Lion.

THESEUS^
Good job, Lion.

LYSANDER
And so the lion vanished.

LYSANDER^
And just like that, the lion's gone.

DEMETRIUS
And then came Pyramus.

DEMETRIUS^
And here comes Pyramus.

INT. ATHENS - THE PALACE OF THESEUS - DAY - CONTINUOUS

Enter Pyramus

PYRAMUS
Sweet Moon, I thank thee for thy sunny beams;
I thank thee, Moon, for shining now so bright;
For, by thy gracious, golden, glittering gleams,
I trust to take of truest Thisby sight.
But stay, O spite!
But mark, poor knight,
What dreadful dole is here!
Eyes, do you see?
How can it be?
O dainty duck! O dear!
Thy mantle good,
What, stain'd with blood!
Approach, ye Furies fell!
O Fates, come, come,
Cut thread and thrum;
Quail, crush, conclude, and quell!

PYRAMUS^
Thanks, Moon, for your bright light;
I'm grateful, Moon, you shine so bright tonight.
By your golden glow, I hope to see
My true love Thisby, wherever she may be.
But wait, what's this?
Oh no, what a mess!
Is this what I think I see?
Is this real?
How should I feel?
Oh no, not her cloak! Oh gee!
It's stained with red,
Could she be dead?
Come, dark forces, set this right!
O Fates, hear my plea,
End this tragedy;
End it all, end it tonight!

THESEUS
This passion, and the death of a dear friend, would
go near to make a man look sad.

THESEUS^
Such emotion, and the loss of a friend,
Would make anyone look sad in the end.

HIPPOLYTA
Beshrew my heart, but I pity the man.

HIPPOLYTA^
I can't help but feel sorry for him.

PYRAMUS
O wherefore, Nature, didst thou lions frame?
Since lion vile hath here deflower'd my dear:
Which is - no, no -
which was the fairest dame
That lived, that loved, that liked, that look'd with cheer.
Come, tears, confound;
Out, sword, and wound
The pap of Pyramus; Ay, that left pap,
Where heart doth hop:
(Stabs himself)
Thus die I, thus, thus, thus.
Now am I dead,
Now am I fled;
My soul is in the sky:
Tongue, lose thy light;
Moon take thy flight:
Now die, die, die, die, die.

PYRAMUS^
Why did nature even create lions?
Since a lion has taken my love away:
Who was - no, no -
who used to be the most beautiful woman
Who lived, who loved, who was happy, who was cheerful.
Come on, tears, let's go;
Draw, sword, and strike
My chest; yes, right where my heart beats:
(Stabs himself)
I die like this, just like this.
I'm now dead,
I'm now gone;
My soul is up in the sky:
Tongue, lose your voice;
Moon, disappear:
Now die, die, die, die, die.

Exit Moonshine. Pyramus Dies.

DEMETRIUS
No die, but an ace, for him; for he is but one.

DEMETRIUS^
He's not a die, just an ace; he's only one person.

LYSANDER
Less than an ace, man; for he is dead; he is nothing.

LYSANDER^
Less than an ace, actually; he's dead, he's nothing.

THESEUS
With the help of a surgeon he might yet recover, and
prove an ass.

THESEUS^
Maybe with some medical help, he could come back to life
and still be a fool.

HIPPOLYTA
How chance Moonshine is gone before Thisbe comes
back and finds her lover?

HIPPOLYTA^
Why did Moonshine leave before Thisbe could return
and find her lover?

THESEUS
She will find him by starlight. Here she comes; and
her passion ends the play.

THESEUS^
She'll find him under the stars. Here she comes, and
her emotional scene will end the play.

INT. ATHENS - THE PALACE OF THESEUS - DAY - CONTINUOUS

Re-enter Thisbe

HIPPOLYTA
Methinks she should not use a long one for such a 
Pyramus: I hope she will be brief.

HIPPOLYTA^
I hope she keeps it short, given the situation with Pyramus.

DEMETRIUS
A mote will turn the balance, which Pyramus, which 
Thisbe, is the better; he for a man, God warrant us; she for a woman, God bless us.

DEMETRIUS^
It's a toss-up between Pyramus and Thisbe; he's a good man, and she's a good woman.

LYSANDER
She hath spied him already with those sweet eyes.

LYSANDER^
She's already seen him with those loving eyes.

DEMETRIUS
And thus she means, videlicet: -

DEMETRIUS^
And here's what she's saying:

THISBE
Asleep, my love?
What, dead, my dove?
O Pyramus, arise!
Speak, speak. Quite dumb?
Dead, dead? A tomb
Must cover thy sweet eyes.
These My lips,
This cherry nose,
These yellow cowslip cheeks,
Are gone, are gone:
Lovers, make moan:
His eyes were green as leeks.
O Sisters Three,
Come, come to me,
With hands as pale as milk;
Lay them in gore,
Since you have shore
With shears his thread of silk.
Tongue, not a word:
Come, trusty sword;
Come, blade, my breast imbrue:
(Stabs herself)
And, farewell, friends;
Thus Thisby ends:
Adieu, adieu, adieu.

THISBE^
Are you sleeping, my love?
What, you're dead?
Wake up, Pyramus!
Speak, are you mute?
Dead? Then a grave
Must cover your beautiful eyes.
My lips,
My cute nose,
My rosy cheeks,
Are all gone:
Lovers, mourn:
His eyes were as green as grass.
O Fates,
Come to me,
With hands as white as milk;
Cover them in blood,
Since you've cut
His life thread.
No more words:
Come, trusty sword;
Stab my heart:
(Stabs herself)
Goodbye, everyone;
This is how Thisbe ends:
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.

Thisbe Dies.

THESEUS
Moonshine and Lion are left to bury the dead.

THESEUS^
Moonshine and Lion are left to handle the funerals.

DEMETRIUS
Ay, and Wall too.

DEMETRIUS^
Yeah, and don't forget the Wall.

BOTTOM
No assure you; the wall is down that parted their fathers. Will it please you to see the epilogue, or to hear a Bergomask dance between two of our company?

BOTTOM^
Just to clarify, the wall that separated their families is down. Would you like to see an epilogue or watch a dance between two of us?

THESEUS
No epilogue, I pray you; for your play needs no excuse. Never excuse; for when the players are all dead, there needs none to be blamed. Marry, if he that writ it had played Pyramus and hanged himself in Thisbe's garter, it would have been a fine tragedy: and so it is, truly; and very notably discharged. But come, your Bergomask: let your epilogue alone. The iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve: Lovers, to bed; 'tis almost fairy time. I fear we shall out-sleep the coming morn As much as we this night have overwatch'd. palpable-gross play hath well beguiled The heavy gait of night. Sweet friends, to bed. A fortnight hold we this solemnity, In nightly revels and new jollity.

THESEUS^
No need for an epilogue; the play speaks for itself. When everyone's dead, there's no one to blame. If the writer had played Pyramus and hanged himself with Thisbe's garter, it would've been a great tragedy. But it's already good as it is. Let's see the dance and skip the epilogue. It's midnight; time for lovers to go to bed. We've stayed up late, and the play has made the night pass quickly. Let's all go to bed. We'll continue celebrating for the next two weeks with nightly parties and fun.

Exit

INT. ATHENS - THE PALACE OF THESEUS - DAY - CONTINUOUS

PUCK
Now the hungry lion roars, 
And the wolf behowls the moon;
...
I am sent with broom before,
To sweep the dust behind the door.

PUCK^
The lion's hungry and he's roaring,
And the wolf's howling at the moon;
...
I've got a broom to sweep,
And clean up this room before we meet.

Enter OBERON and TITANIA with their train

OBERON
Through the house give gathering light,
By the dead and drowsy fire: Every elf and fairy sprite
Hop as light as bird from brier; And this ditty, after me,
Sing, and dance it trippingly.

OBERON^
Light up the house, let's make it bright,
By the cozy, sleepy fire: Every elf and fairy, take flight,
Jump as if you're hopping off a wire; Follow my lead,
Sing and dance with speed.

TITANIA
First, rehearse your song by rote
To each word a warbling note:
Hand in hand, with fairy grace, Will we sing, and bless this place.

TITANIA^
First, let's practice the song,
Each word should be melodious and long:
Hand in hand, with elegance and grace, We'll sing and bless this space.

Song and dance.

OBERON
Now, until the break of day,
Through this house each fairy stray.
To the best bride-bed will we,
Which by us shall blessed be;
And the issue there create
Ever shall be fortunate.
So shall all the couples three
Ever true in loving be;
And the blots of Nature's hand
Shall not in their issue stand;
Never mole, hare lip, nor scar,
Nor mark prodigious, such as are
Despised in nativity,
Shall upon their children be.
With this field-dew consecrate,
Every fairy take his gait;
And each several chamber bless,
Through this palace, with sweet peace;
And the owner of it blest
Ever shall in safety rest.
Trip away; make no stay;
Meet me all by break of day.

OBERON^
Until dawn, let every fairy wander through this house.
We'll go to the best wedding bed,
Which we'll bless;
And the children born there
Will always be lucky.
All three couples will always be in love;
And no physical flaws or birthmarks
Will be passed on to their children.
With this magical dew,
Every fairy go your way;
Bless each room in this palace with peace.
And the owner will always be safe.
Hurry up, don't delay;
See you all at dawn.

Exeunt OBERON, TITANIA, and train

INT. ATHENS - THE PALACE OF THESEUS - DAY - CONTINUOUS

PUCK
If we shadows have offended,
Think but this, and all is mended,
That you have but slumber'd here
While these visions did appear.
And this weak and idle theme,
No more yielding but a dream,
Gentles, do not reprehend:
if you pardon, we will mend:
And, as I am an honest Puck,
If we have unearned luck
Now to 'scape the serpent's tongue,
We will make amends ere long;
Else the Puck a liar call;
So, good night unto you all
Give me your hands, if we be friends,
And Robin shall restore amends.

PUCK^
If we've upset you with our play,
Just think of it this way,
You were asleep and dreaming here
While we performed near.
This story, light and not too keen,
Is nothing more than a dream.
So, don't be mad and don't resent;
If you forgive, we're content.
And trust me, I'm an honest sprite,
If we've been lucky to avoid a fight,
We'll make it right, just wait and see,
Or call me a liar, as Puck I be.
So, goodnight to one and all,
Give me a clap, if friends we're called,
And Robin will make amends to you.
