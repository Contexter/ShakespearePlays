# ACT I
## SCENE Athens. The palace of THESEUS
<A NAME=1.1.1>Now, fair Hippolyta, our nuptial hour</A>
<A NAME=1.1.2>Draws on apace; four happy days bring in</A>
<A NAME=1.1.3>Another moon: but, O, methinks, how slow</A>
<A NAME=1.1.4>This old moon wanes! she lingers my desires,</A>
<A NAME=1.1.5>Like to a step-dame or a dowager</A>
<A NAME=1.1.6>Long withering out a young man revenue.</A>
<A NAME=1.1.7>Four days will quickly steep themselves in night;</A>
<A NAME=1.1.8>Four nights will quickly dream away the time;</A>
<A NAME=1.1.9>And then the moon, like to a silver bow</A>
<A NAME=1.1.10>New-bent in heaven, shall behold the night</A>
<A NAME=1.1.11>Of our solemnities.</A>
<A NAME=1.1.12>Go, Philostrate,</A>
<A NAME=1.1.13>Stir up the Athenian youth to merriments;</A>
<A NAME=1.1.14>Awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth;</A>
<A NAME=1.1.15>Turn melancholy forth to funerals;</A>
<A NAME=1.1.16>The pale companion is not for our pomp.</A>
Exit PHILOSTRATE
<A NAME=1.1.17>Hippolyta, I woo'd thee with my sword,</A>
<A NAME=1.1.18>And won thy love, doing thee injuries;</A>
<A NAME=1.1.19>But I will wed thee in another key,</A>
<A NAME=1.1.20>With pomp, with triumph and with revelling.</A>
Enter EGEUS, HERMIA, LYSANDER, and DEMETRIUS
<A NAME=1.1.21>Happy be Theseus, our renowned duke!</A>
<A NAME=1.1.22>Thanks, good Egeus: what's the news with thee?</A>
<A NAME=1.1.23>Full of vexation come I, with complaint</A>
<A NAME=1.1.24>Against my child, my daughter Hermia.</A>
<A NAME=1.1.25>Stand forth, Demetrius. My noble lord,</A>
<A NAME=1.1.26>This man hath my consent to marry her.</A>
<A NAME=1.1.27>Stand forth, Lysander: and my gracious duke,</A>
<A NAME=1.1.28>This man hath bewitch'd the bosom of my child;</A>
<A NAME=1.1.29>Thou, thou, Lysander, thou hast given her rhymes,</A>
<A NAME=1.1.30>And interchanged love-tokens with my child:</A>
<A NAME=1.1.31>Thou hast by moonlight at her window sung,</A>
<A NAME=1.1.32>With feigning voice verses of feigning love,</A>
<A NAME=1.1.33>And stolen the impression of her fantasy</A>
<A NAME=1.1.34>With bracelets of thy hair, rings, gawds, conceits,</A>
<A NAME=1.1.35>Knacks, trifles, nosegays, sweetmeats, messengers</A>
<A NAME=1.1.36>Of strong prevailment in unharden'd youth:</A>
<A NAME=1.1.37>With cunning hast thou filch'd my daughter's heart,</A>
<A NAME=1.1.38>Turn'd her obedience, which is due to me,</A>
<A NAME=1.1.39>To stubborn harshness: and, my gracious duke,</A>
<A NAME=1.1.40>Be it so she; will not here before your grace</A>
<A NAME=1.1.41>Consent to marry with Demetrius,</A>
<A NAME=1.1.42>I beg the ancient privilege of Athens,</A>
<A NAME=1.1.43>As she is mine, I may dispose of her:</A>
<A NAME=1.1.44>Which shall be either to this gentleman</A>
<A NAME=1.1.45>Or to her death, according to our law</A>
<A NAME=1.1.46>Immediately provided in that case.</A>
<A NAME=1.1.47>What say you, Hermia? be advised fair maid:</A>
<A NAME=1.1.48>To you your father should be as a god;</A>
<A NAME=1.1.49>One that composed your beauties, yea, and one</A>
<A NAME=1.1.50>To whom you are but as a form in wax</A>
<A NAME=1.1.51>By him imprinted and within his power</A>
<A NAME=1.1.52>To leave the figure or disfigure it.</A>
<A NAME=1.1.53>Demetrius is a worthy gentleman.</A>
<A NAME=1.1.54>So is Lysander.</A>
<A NAME=1.1.55>                  In himself he is;</A>
<A NAME=1.1.56>But in this kind, wanting your father's voice,</A>
<A NAME=1.1.57>The other must be held the worthier.</A>
<A NAME=1.1.58>I would my father look'd but with my eyes.</A>
<A NAME=1.1.59>Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.</A>
<A NAME=1.1.60>I do entreat your grace to pardon me.</A>
<A NAME=1.1.61>I know not by what power I am made bold,</A>
<A NAME=1.1.62>Nor how it may concern my modesty,</A>
<A NAME=1.1.63>In such a presence here to plead my thoughts;</A>
<A NAME=1.1.64>But I beseech your grace that I may know</A>
<A NAME=1.1.65>The worst that may befall me in this case,</A>
<A NAME=1.1.66>If I refuse to wed Demetrius.</A>
<A NAME=1.1.67>Either to die the death or to abjure</A>
<A NAME=1.1.68>For ever the society of men.</A>
<A NAME=1.1.69>Therefore, fair Hermia, question your desires;</A>
<A NAME=1.1.70>Know of your youth, examine well your blood,</A>
<A NAME=1.1.71>Whether, if you yield not to your father's choice,</A>
<A NAME=1.1.72>You can endure the livery of a nun,</A>
<A NAME=1.1.73>For aye to be in shady cloister mew'd,</A>
<A NAME=1.1.74>To live a barren sister all your life,</A>
<A NAME=1.1.75>Chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon.</A>
<A NAME=1.1.76>Thrice-blessed they that master so their blood,</A>
<A NAME=1.1.77>To undergo such maiden pilgrimage;</A>
<A NAME=1.1.78>But earthlier happy is the rose distill'd,</A>
<A NAME=1.1.79>Than that which withering on the virgin thorn</A>
<A NAME=1.1.80>Grows, lives and dies in single blessedness.</A>
<A NAME=1.1.81>So will I grow, so live, so die, my lord,</A>
<A NAME=1.1.82>Ere I will my virgin patent up</A>
<A NAME=1.1.83>Unto his lordship, whose unwished yoke</A>
<A NAME=1.1.84>My soul consents not to give sovereignty.</A>
<A NAME=1.1.85>Take time to pause; and, by the next new moon--</A>
<A NAME=1.1.86>The sealing-day betwixt my love and me,</A>
<A NAME=1.1.87>For everlasting bond of fellowship--</A>
<A NAME=1.1.88>Upon that day either prepare to die</A>
<A NAME=1.1.89>For disobedience to your father's will,</A>
<A NAME=1.1.90>Or else to wed Demetrius, as he would;</A>
<A NAME=1.1.91>Or on Diana's altar to protest</A>
<A NAME=1.1.92>For aye austerity and single life.</A>
<A NAME=1.1.93>Relent, sweet Hermia: and, Lysander, yield</A>
<A NAME=1.1.94>Thy crazed title to my certain right.</A>
<A NAME=1.1.95>You have her father's love, Demetrius;</A>
<A NAME=1.1.96>Let me have Hermia's: do you marry him.</A>
<A NAME=1.1.97>Scornful Lysander! true, he hath my love,</A>
<A NAME=1.1.98>And what is mine my love shall render him.</A>
<A NAME=1.1.99>And she is mine, and all my right of her</A>
<A NAME=1.1.100>I do estate unto Demetrius.</A>
<A NAME=1.1.101>I am, my lord, as well derived as he,</A>
<A NAME=1.1.102>As well possess'd; my love is more than his;</A>
<A NAME=1.1.103>My fortunes every way as fairly rank'd,</A>
<A NAME=1.1.104>If not with vantage, as Demetrius';</A>
<A NAME=1.1.105>And, which is more than all these boasts can be,</A>
<A NAME=1.1.106>I am beloved of beauteous Hermia:</A>
<A NAME=1.1.107>Why should not I then prosecute my right?</A>
<A NAME=1.1.108>Demetrius, I'll avouch it to his head,</A>
<A NAME=1.1.109>Made love to Nedar's daughter, Helena,</A>
<A NAME=1.1.110>And won her soul; and she, sweet lady, dotes,</A>
<A NAME=1.1.111>Devoutly dotes, dotes in idolatry,</A>
<A NAME=1.1.112>Upon this spotted and inconstant man.</A>
<A NAME=1.1.113>I must confess that I have heard so much,</A>
<A NAME=1.1.114>And with Demetrius thought to have spoke thereof;</A>
<A NAME=1.1.115>But, being over-full of self-affairs,</A>
<A NAME=1.1.116>My mind did lose it. But, Demetrius, come;</A>
<A NAME=1.1.117>And come, Egeus; you shall go with me,</A>
<A NAME=1.1.118>I have some private schooling for you both.</A>
<A NAME=1.1.119>For you, fair Hermia, look you arm yourself</A>
<A NAME=1.1.120>To fit your fancies to your father's will;</A>
<A NAME=1.1.121>Or else the law of Athens yields you up--</A>
<A NAME=1.1.122>Which by no means we may extenuate--</A>
<A NAME=1.1.123>To death, or to a vow of single life.</A>
<A NAME=1.1.124>Come, my Hippolyta: what cheer, my love?</A>
<A NAME=1.1.125>Demetrius and Egeus, go along:</A>
<A NAME=1.1.126>I must employ you in some business</A>
<A NAME=1.1.127>Against our nuptial and confer with you</A>
<A NAME=1.1.128>Of something nearly that concerns yourselves.</A>
<A NAME=1.1.129>With duty and desire we follow you.</A>
Exeunt all but LYSANDER and HERMIA
<A NAME=1.1.130>How now, my love! why is your cheek so pale?</A>
<A NAME=1.1.131>How chance the roses there do fade so fast?</A>
<A NAME=1.1.132>Belike for want of rain, which I could well</A>
<A NAME=1.1.133>Beteem them from the tempest of my eyes.</A>
<A NAME=1.1.134>Ay me! for aught that I could ever read,</A>
<A NAME=1.1.135>Could ever hear by tale or history,</A>
<A NAME=1.1.136>The course of true love never did run smooth;</A>
<A NAME=1.1.137>But, either it was different in blood,--</A>
<A NAME=1.1.138>O cross! too high to be enthrall'd to low.</A>
<A NAME=1.1.139>Or else misgraffed in respect of years,--</A>
<A NAME=1.1.140>O spite! too old to be engaged to young.</A>
<A NAME=1.1.141>Or else it stood upon the choice of friends,--</A>
<A NAME=1.1.142>O hell! to choose love by another's eyes.</A>
<A NAME=1.1.143>Or, if there were a sympathy in choice,</A>
<A NAME=1.1.144>War, death, or sickness did lay siege to it,</A>
<A NAME=1.1.145>Making it momentany as a sound,</A>
<A NAME=1.1.146>Swift as a shadow, short as any dream;</A>
<A NAME=1.1.147>Brief as the lightning in the collied night,</A>
<A NAME=1.1.148>That, in a spleen, unfolds both heaven and earth,</A>
<A NAME=1.1.149>And ere a man hath power to say 'Behold!'</A>
<A NAME=1.1.150>The jaws of darkness do devour it up:</A>
<A NAME=1.1.151>So quick bright things come to confusion.</A>
<A NAME=1.1.152>If then true lovers have been ever cross'd,</A>
<A NAME=1.1.153>It stands as an edict in destiny:</A>
<A NAME=1.1.154>Then let us teach our trial patience,</A>
<A NAME=1.1.155>Because it is a customary cross,</A>
<A NAME=1.1.156>As due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs,</A>
<A NAME=1.1.157>Wishes and tears, poor fancy's followers.</A>
<A NAME=1.1.158>A good persuasion: therefore, hear me, Hermia.</A>
<A NAME=1.1.159>I have a widow aunt, a dowager</A>
<A NAME=1.1.160>Of great revenue, and she hath no child:</A>
<A NAME=1.1.161>From Athens is her house remote seven leagues;</A>
<A NAME=1.1.162>And she respects me as her only son.</A>
<A NAME=1.1.163>There, gentle Hermia, may I marry thee;</A>
<A NAME=1.1.164>And to that place the sharp Athenian law</A>
<A NAME=1.1.165>Cannot pursue us. If thou lovest me then,</A>
<A NAME=1.1.166>Steal forth thy father's house to-morrow night;</A>
<A NAME=1.1.167>And in the wood, a league without the town,</A>
<A NAME=1.1.168>Where I did meet thee once with Helena,</A>
<A NAME=1.1.169>To do observance to a morn of May,</A>
<A NAME=1.1.170>There will I stay for thee.</A>
<A NAME=1.1.171>My good Lysander!</A>
<A NAME=1.1.172>I swear to thee, by Cupid's strongest bow,</A>
<A NAME=1.1.173>By his best arrow with the golden head,</A>
<A NAME=1.1.174>By the simplicity of Venus' doves,</A>
<A NAME=1.1.175>By that which knitteth souls and prospers loves,</A>
<A NAME=1.1.176>And by that fire which burn'd the Carthage queen,</A>
<A NAME=1.1.177>When the false Troyan under sail was seen,</A>
<A NAME=1.1.178>By all the vows that ever men have broke,</A>
<A NAME=1.1.179>In number more than ever women spoke,</A>
<A NAME=1.1.180>In that same place thou hast appointed me,</A>
<A NAME=1.1.181>To-morrow truly will I meet with thee.</A>
<A NAME=1.1.182>Keep promise, love. Look, here comes Helena.</A>
Enter HELENA
<A NAME=1.1.183>God speed fair Helena! whither away?</A>
<A NAME=1.1.184>Call you me fair? that fair again unsay.</A>
<A NAME=1.1.185>Demetrius loves your fair: O happy fair!</A>
<A NAME=1.1.186>Your eyes are lode-stars; and your tongue's sweet air</A>
<A NAME=1.1.187>More tuneable than lark to shepherd's ear,</A>
<A NAME=1.1.188>When wheat is green, when hawthorn buds appear.</A>
<A NAME=1.1.189>Sickness is catching: O, were favour so,</A>
<A NAME=1.1.190>Yours would I catch, fair Hermia, ere I go;</A>
<A NAME=1.1.191>My ear should catch your voice, my eye your eye,</A>
<A NAME=1.1.192>My tongue should catch your tongue's sweet melody.</A>
<A NAME=1.1.193>Were the world mine, Demetrius being bated,</A>
<A NAME=1.1.194>The rest I'd give to be to you translated.</A>
<A NAME=1.1.195>O, teach me how you look, and with what art</A>
<A NAME=1.1.196>You sway the motion of Demetrius' heart.</A>
<A NAME=1.1.197>I frown upon him, yet he loves me still.</A>
<A NAME=1.1.198>O that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill!</A>
<A NAME=1.1.199>I give him curses, yet he gives me love.</A>
<A NAME=1.1.200>O that my prayers could such affection move!</A>
<A NAME=1.1.201>The more I hate, the more he follows me.</A>
<A NAME=1.1.202>The more I love, the more he hateth me.</A>
<A NAME=1.1.203>His folly, Helena, is no fault of mine.</A>
<A NAME=1.1.204>None, but your beauty: would that fault were mine!</A>
<A NAME=1.1.205>Take comfort: he no more shall see my face;</A>
<A NAME=1.1.206>Lysander and myself will fly this place.</A>
<A NAME=1.1.207>Before the time I did Lysander see,</A>
<A NAME=1.1.208>Seem'd Athens as a paradise to me:</A>
<A NAME=1.1.209>O, then, what graces in my love do dwell,</A>
<A NAME=1.1.210>That he hath turn'd a heaven unto a hell!</A>
<A NAME=1.1.211>Helen, to you our minds we will unfold:</A>
<A NAME=1.1.212>To-morrow night, when Phoebe doth behold</A>
<A NAME=1.1.213>Her silver visage in the watery glass,</A>
<A NAME=1.1.214>Decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass,</A>
<A NAME=1.1.215>A time that lovers' flights doth still conceal,</A>
<A NAME=1.1.216>Through Athens' gates have we devised to steal.</A>
<A NAME=1.1.217>And in the wood, where often you and I</A>
<A NAME=1.1.218>Upon faint primrose-beds were wont to lie,</A>
<A NAME=1.1.219>Emptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet,</A>
<A NAME=1.1.220>There my Lysander and myself shall meet;</A>
<A NAME=1.1.221>And thence from Athens turn away our eyes,</A>
<A NAME=1.1.222>To seek new friends and stranger companies.</A>
<A NAME=1.1.223>Farewell, sweet playfellow: pray thou for us;</A>
<A NAME=1.1.224>And good luck grant thee thy Demetrius!</A>
<A NAME=1.1.225>Keep word, Lysander: we must starve our sight</A>
<A NAME=1.1.226>From lovers' food till morrow deep midnight.</A>
<A NAME=1.1.227>I will, my Hermia.</A>
Exit HERMIA
<A NAME=1.1.228>Helena, adieu:</A>
<A NAME=1.1.229>As you on him, Demetrius dote on you!</A>
Exit
<A NAME=1.1.230>How happy some o'er other some can be!</A>
<A NAME=1.1.231>Through Athens I am thought as fair as she.</A>
<A NAME=1.1.232>But what of that? Demetrius thinks not so;</A>
<A NAME=1.1.233>He will not know what all but he do know:</A>
<A NAME=1.1.234>And as he errs, doting on Hermia's eyes,</A>
<A NAME=1.1.235>So I, admiring of his qualities:</A>
<A NAME=1.1.236>Things base and vile, folding no quantity,</A>
<A NAME=1.1.237>Love can transpose to form and dignity:</A>
<A NAME=1.1.238>Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind;</A>
<A NAME=1.1.239>And therefore is wing'd Cupid painted blind:</A>
<A NAME=1.1.240>Nor hath Love's mind of any judgement taste;</A>
<A NAME=1.1.241>Wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste:</A>
<A NAME=1.1.242>And therefore is Love said to be a child,</A>
<A NAME=1.1.243>Because in choice he is so oft beguiled.</A>
<A NAME=1.1.244>As waggish boys in game themselves forswear,</A>
<A NAME=1.1.245>So the boy Love is perjured every where:</A>
<A NAME=1.1.246>For ere Demetrius look'd on Hermia's eyne,</A>
<A NAME=1.1.247>He hail'd down oaths that he was only mine;</A>
<A NAME=1.1.248>And when this hail some heat from Hermia felt,</A>
<A NAME=1.1.249>So he dissolved, and showers of oaths did melt.</A>
<A NAME=1.1.250>I will go tell him of fair Hermia's flight:</A>
<A NAME=1.1.251>Then to the wood will he to-morrow night</A>
<A NAME=1.1.252>Pursue her; and for this intelligence</A>
<A NAME=1.1.253>If I have thanks, it is a dear expense:</A>
<A NAME=1.1.254>But herein mean I to enrich my pain,</A>
<A NAME=1.1.255>To have his sight thither and back again.</A>

## SCENE Athens. QUINCE'S house
<A NAME=1.2.1>Is all our company here?</A>
<A NAME=1.2.2>You were best to call them generally, man by man,</A>
<A NAME=1.2.3>according to the scrip.</A>
<A NAME=1.2.4>Here is the scroll of every man's name, which is</A>
<A NAME=1.2.5>thought fit, through all Athens, to play in our</A>
<A NAME=1.2.6>interlude before the duke and the duchess, on his</A>
<A NAME=1.2.7>wedding-day at night.</A>
<A NAME=1.2.8>First, good Peter Quince, say what the play treats</A>
<A NAME=1.2.9>on, then read the names of the actors, and so grow</A>
<A NAME=1.2.10>to a point.</A>
<A NAME=1.2.11>Marry, our play is, The most lamentable comedy, and</A>
<A NAME=1.2.12>most cruel death of Pyramus and Thisby.</A>
<A NAME=1.2.13>A very good piece of work, I assure you, and a</A>
<A NAME=1.2.14>merry. Now, good Peter Quince, call forth your</A>
<A NAME=1.2.15>actors by the scroll. Masters, spread yourselves.</A>
<A NAME=1.2.16>Answer as I call you. Nick Bottom, the weaver.</A>
<A NAME=1.2.17>Ready. Name what part I am for, and proceed.</A>
<A NAME=1.2.18>You, Nick Bottom, are set down for Pyramus.</A>
<A NAME=1.2.19>What is Pyramus? a lover, or a tyrant?</A>
<A NAME=1.2.20>A lover, that kills himself most gallant for love.</A>
<A NAME=1.2.21>That will ask some tears in the true performing of</A>
<A NAME=1.2.22>it: if I do it, let the audience look to their</A>
<A NAME=1.2.23>eyes; I will move storms, I will condole in some</A>
<A NAME=1.2.24>measure. To the rest: yet my chief humour is for a</A>
<A NAME=1.2.25>tyrant: I could play Ercles rarely, or a part to</A>
<A NAME=1.2.26>tear a cat in, to make all split.</A>
<A NAME=1.2.27>The raging rocks</A>
<A NAME=1.2.28>And shivering shocks</A>
<A NAME=1.2.29>Shall break the locks</A>
<A NAME=1.2.30>Of prison gates;</A>
<A NAME=1.2.31>And Phibbus' car</A>
<A NAME=1.2.32>Shall shine from far</A>
<A NAME=1.2.33>And make and mar</A>
<A NAME=1.2.34>The foolish Fates.</A>
<A NAME=1.2.35>This was lofty! Now name the rest of the players.</A>
<A NAME=1.2.36>This is Ercles' vein, a tyrant's vein; a lover is</A>
<A NAME=1.2.37>more condoling.</A>
<A NAME=1.2.38>Francis Flute, the bellows-mender.</A>
<A NAME=1.2.39>Here, Peter Quince.</A>
<A NAME=1.2.40>Flute, you must take Thisby on you.</A>
<A NAME=1.2.41>What is Thisby? a wandering knight?</A>
<A NAME=1.2.42>It is the lady that Pyramus must love.</A>
<A NAME=1.2.43>Nay, faith, let me not play a woman; I have a beard coming.</A>
<A NAME=1.2.44>That's all one: you shall play it in a mask, and</A>
<A NAME=1.2.45>you may speak as small as you will.</A>
<A NAME=1.2.46>An I may hide my face, let me play Thisby too, I'll</A>
<A NAME=1.2.47>speak in a monstrous little voice. 'Thisne,</A>
<A NAME=1.2.48>Thisne;' 'Ah, Pyramus, lover dear! thy Thisby dear,</A>
<A NAME=1.2.49>and lady dear!'</A>
<A NAME=1.2.50>No, no; you must play Pyramus: and, Flute, you Thisby.</A>
<A NAME=1.2.51>Well, proceed.</A>
<A NAME=1.2.52>Robin Starveling, the tailor.</A>
<A NAME=1.2.53>Here, Peter Quince.</A>
<A NAME=1.2.54>Robin Starveling, you must play Thisby's mother.</A>
<A NAME=1.2.55>Tom Snout, the tinker.</A>
<A NAME=1.2.56>Here, Peter Quince.</A>
<A NAME=1.2.57>You, Pyramus' father: myself, Thisby's father:</A>
<A NAME=1.2.58>Snug, the joiner; you, the lion's part: and, I</A>
<A NAME=1.2.59>hope, here is a play fitted.</A>
<A NAME=1.2.60>Have you the lion's part written? pray you, if it</A>
<A NAME=1.2.61>be, give it me, for I am slow of study.</A>
<A NAME=1.2.62>You may do it extempore, for it is nothing but roaring.</A>
<A NAME=1.2.63>Let me play the lion too: I will roar, that I will</A>
<A NAME=1.2.64>do any man's heart good to hear me; I will roar,</A>
<A NAME=1.2.65>that I will make the duke say 'Let him roar again,</A>
<A NAME=1.2.66>let him roar again.'</A>
<A NAME=1.2.67>An you should do it too terribly, you would fright</A>
<A NAME=1.2.68>the duchess and the ladies, that they would shriek;</A>
<A NAME=1.2.69>and that were enough to hang us all.</A>
<A NAME=1.2.70>That would hang us, every mother's son.</A>
<A NAME=1.2.71>I grant you, friends, if that you should fright the</A>
<A NAME=1.2.72>ladies out of their wits, they would have no more</A>
<A NAME=1.2.73>discretion but to hang us: but I will aggravate my</A>
<A NAME=1.2.74>voice so that I will roar you as gently as any</A>
<A NAME=1.2.75>sucking dove; I will roar you an 'twere any</A>
<A NAME=1.2.76>nightingale.</A>
<A NAME=1.2.77>You can play no part but Pyramus; for Pyramus is a</A>
<A NAME=1.2.78>sweet-faced man; a proper man, as one shall see in a</A>
<A NAME=1.2.79>summer's day; a most lovely gentleman-like man:</A>
<A NAME=1.2.80>therefore you must needs play Pyramus.</A>
<A NAME=1.2.81>Well, I will undertake it. What beard were I best</A>
<A NAME=1.2.82>to play it in?</A>
<A NAME=1.2.83>Why, what you will.</A>
<A NAME=1.2.84>I will discharge it in either your straw-colour</A>
<A NAME=1.2.85>beard, your orange-tawny beard, your purple-in-grain</A>
<A NAME=1.2.86>beard, or your French-crown-colour beard, your</A>
<A NAME=1.2.87>perfect yellow.</A>
<A NAME=1.2.88>Some of your French crowns have no hair at all, and</A>
<A NAME=1.2.89>then you will play bare-faced. But, masters, here</A>
<A NAME=1.2.90>are your parts: and I am to entreat you, request</A>
<A NAME=1.2.91>you and desire you, to con them by to-morrow night;</A>
<A NAME=1.2.92>and meet me in the palace wood, a mile without the</A>
<A NAME=1.2.93>town, by moonlight; there will we rehearse, for if</A>
<A NAME=1.2.94>we meet in the city, we shall be dogged with</A>
<A NAME=1.2.95>company, and our devices known. In the meantime I</A>
<A NAME=1.2.96>will draw a bill of properties, such as our play</A>
<A NAME=1.2.97>wants. I pray you, fail me not.</A>
<A NAME=1.2.98>We will meet; and there we may rehearse most</A>
<A NAME=1.2.99>obscenely and courageously. Take pains; be perfect: adieu.</A>
<A NAME=1.2.100>At the duke's oak we meet.</A>
<A NAME=1.2.101>Enough; hold or cut bow-strings.</A>

# ACT II
## SCENE A wood near Athens
<A NAME=2.1.1>How now, spirit! whither wander you?</A>
<A NAME=2.1.2>     Over hill, over dale,</A>
<A NAME=2.1.3>Thorough bush, thorough brier,</A>
<A NAME=2.1.4>Over park, over pale,</A>
<A NAME=2.1.5>Thorough flood, thorough fire,</A>
<A NAME=2.1.6>I do wander everywhere,</A>
<A NAME=2.1.7>Swifter than the moon's sphere;</A>
<A NAME=2.1.8>And I serve the fairy queen,</A>
<A NAME=2.1.9>To dew her orbs upon the green.</A>
<A NAME=2.1.10>The cowslips tall her pensioners be:</A>
<A NAME=2.1.11>In their gold coats spots you see;</A>
<A NAME=2.1.12>Those be rubies, fairy favours,</A>
<A NAME=2.1.13>In those freckles live their savours:</A>
<A NAME=2.1.14>I must go seek some dewdrops here</A>
<A NAME=2.1.15>And hang a pearl in every cowslip's ear.</A>
<A NAME=2.1.16>Farewell, thou lob of spirits; I'll be gone:</A>
<A NAME=2.1.17>Our queen and all our elves come here anon.</A>
<A NAME=2.1.18>The king doth keep his revels here to-night:</A>
<A NAME=2.1.19>Take heed the queen come not within his sight;</A>
<A NAME=2.1.20>For Oberon is passing fell and wrath,</A>
<A NAME=2.1.21>Because that she as her attendant hath</A>
<A NAME=2.1.22>A lovely boy, stolen from an Indian king;</A>
<A NAME=2.1.23>She never had so sweet a changeling;</A>
<A NAME=2.1.24>And jealous Oberon would have the child</A>
<A NAME=2.1.25>Knight of his train, to trace the forests wild;</A>
<A NAME=2.1.26>But she perforce withholds the loved boy,</A>
<A NAME=2.1.27>Crowns him with flowers and makes him all her joy:</A>
<A NAME=2.1.28>And now they never meet in grove or green,</A>
<A NAME=2.1.29>By fountain clear, or spangled starlight sheen,</A>
<A NAME=2.1.30>But, they do square, that all their elves for fear</A>
<A NAME=2.1.31>Creep into acorn-cups and hide them there.</A>
<A NAME=2.1.32>Either I mistake your shape and making quite,</A>
<A NAME=2.1.33>Or else you are that shrewd and knavish sprite</A>
<A NAME=2.1.34>Call'd Robin Goodfellow: are not you he</A>
<A NAME=2.1.35>That frights the maidens of the villagery;</A>
<A NAME=2.1.36>Skim milk, and sometimes labour in the quern</A>
<A NAME=2.1.37>And bootless make the breathless housewife churn;</A>
<A NAME=2.1.38>And sometime make the drink to bear no barm;</A>
<A NAME=2.1.39>Mislead night-wanderers, laughing at their harm?</A>
<A NAME=2.1.40>Those that Hobgoblin call you and sweet Puck,</A>
<A NAME=2.1.41>You do their work, and they shall have good luck:</A>
<A NAME=2.1.42>Are not you he?</A>
<A NAME=2.1.43>                  Thou speak'st aright;</A>
<A NAME=2.1.44>I am that merry wanderer of the night.</A>
<A NAME=2.1.45>I jest to Oberon and make him smile</A>
<A NAME=2.1.46>When I a fat and bean-fed horse beguile,</A>
<A NAME=2.1.47>Neighing in likeness of a filly foal:</A>
<A NAME=2.1.48>And sometime lurk I in a gossip's bowl,</A>
<A NAME=2.1.49>In very likeness of a roasted crab,</A>
<A NAME=2.1.50>And when she drinks, against her lips I bob</A>
<A NAME=2.1.51>And on her wither'd dewlap pour the ale.</A>
<A NAME=2.1.52>The wisest aunt, telling the saddest tale,</A>
<A NAME=2.1.53>Sometime for three-foot stool mistaketh me;</A>
<A NAME=2.1.54>Then slip I from her bum, down topples she,</A>
<A NAME=2.1.55>And 'tailor' cries, and falls into a cough;</A>
<A NAME=2.1.56>And then the whole quire hold their hips and laugh,</A>
<A NAME=2.1.57>And waxen in their mirth and neeze and swear</A>
<A NAME=2.1.58>A merrier hour was never wasted there.</A>
<A NAME=2.1.59>But, room, fairy! here comes Oberon.</A>
<A NAME=2.1.60>And here my mistress. Would that he were gone!</A>
Enter, from one side, OBERON, with his train; from the other, TITANIA, with hers
<A NAME=2.1.61>Ill met by moonlight, proud Titania.</A>
<A NAME=2.1.62>What, jealous Oberon! Fairies, skip hence:</A>
<A NAME=2.1.63>I have forsworn his bed and company.</A>
<A NAME=2.1.64>Tarry, rash wanton: am not I thy lord?</A>
<A NAME=2.1.65>Then I must be thy lady: but I know</A>
<A NAME=2.1.66>When thou hast stolen away from fairy land,</A>
<A NAME=2.1.67>And in the shape of Corin sat all day,</A>
<A NAME=2.1.68>Playing on pipes of corn and versing love</A>
<A NAME=2.1.69>To amorous Phillida. Why art thou here,</A>
<A NAME=2.1.70>Come from the farthest Steppe of India?</A>
<A NAME=2.1.71>But that, forsooth, the bouncing Amazon,</A>
<A NAME=2.1.72>Your buskin'd mistress and your warrior love,</A>
<A NAME=2.1.73>To Theseus must be wedded, and you come</A>
<A NAME=2.1.74>To give their bed joy and prosperity.</A>
<A NAME=2.1.75>How canst thou thus for shame, Titania,</A>
<A NAME=2.1.76>Glance at my credit with Hippolyta,</A>
<A NAME=2.1.77>Knowing I know thy love to Theseus?</A>
<A NAME=2.1.78>Didst thou not lead him through the glimmering night</A>
<A NAME=2.1.79>From Perigenia, whom he ravished?</A>
<A NAME=2.1.80>And make him with fair AEgle break his faith,</A>
<A NAME=2.1.81>With Ariadne and Antiopa?</A>
<A NAME=2.1.82>These are the forgeries of jealousy:</A>
<A NAME=2.1.83>And never, since the middle summer's spring,</A>
<A NAME=2.1.84>Met we on hill, in dale, forest or mead,</A>
<A NAME=2.1.85>By paved fountain or by rushy brook,</A>
<A NAME=2.1.86>Or in the beached margent of the sea,</A>
<A NAME=2.1.87>To dance our ringlets to the whistling wind,</A>
<A NAME=2.1.88>But with thy brawls thou hast disturb'd our sport.</A>
<A NAME=2.1.89>Therefore the winds, piping to us in vain,</A>
<A NAME=2.1.90>As in revenge, have suck'd up from the sea</A>
<A NAME=2.1.91>Contagious fogs; which falling in the land</A>
<A NAME=2.1.92>Have every pelting river made so proud</A>
<A NAME=2.1.93>That they have overborne their continents:</A>
<A NAME=2.1.94>The ox hath therefore stretch'd his yoke in vain,</A>
<A NAME=2.1.95>The ploughman lost his sweat, and the green corn</A>
<A NAME=2.1.96>Hath rotted ere his youth attain'd a beard;</A>
<A NAME=2.1.97>The fold stands empty in the drowned field,</A>
<A NAME=2.1.98>And crows are fatted with the murrion flock;</A>
<A NAME=2.1.99>The nine men's morris is fill'd up with mud,</A>
<A NAME=2.1.100>And the quaint mazes in the wanton green</A>
<A NAME=2.1.101>For lack of tread are undistinguishable:</A>
<A NAME=2.1.102>The human mortals want their winter here;</A>
<A NAME=2.1.103>No night is now with hymn or carol blest:</A>
<A NAME=2.1.104>Therefore the moon, the governess of floods,</A>
<A NAME=2.1.105>Pale in her anger, washes all the air,</A>
<A NAME=2.1.106>That rheumatic diseases do abound:</A>
<A NAME=2.1.107>And thorough this distemperature we see</A>
<A NAME=2.1.108>The seasons alter: hoary-headed frosts</A>
<A NAME=2.1.109>Far in the fresh lap of the crimson rose,</A>
<A NAME=2.1.110>And on old Hiems' thin and icy crown</A>
<A NAME=2.1.111>An odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds</A>
<A NAME=2.1.112>Is, as in mockery, set: the spring, the summer,</A>
<A NAME=2.1.113>The childing autumn, angry winter, change</A>
<A NAME=2.1.114>Their wonted liveries, and the mazed world,</A>
<A NAME=2.1.115>By their increase, now knows not which is which:</A>
<A NAME=2.1.116>And this same progeny of evils comes</A>
<A NAME=2.1.117>From our debate, from our dissension;</A>
<A NAME=2.1.118>We are their parents and original.</A>
<A NAME=2.1.119>Do you amend it then; it lies in you:</A>
<A NAME=2.1.120>Why should Titania cross her Oberon?</A>
<A NAME=2.1.121>I do but beg a little changeling boy,</A>
<A NAME=2.1.122>To be my henchman.</A>
<A NAME=2.1.123>                  Set your heart at rest:</A>
<A NAME=2.1.124>The fairy land buys not the child of me.</A>
<A NAME=2.1.125>His mother was a votaress of my order:</A>
<A NAME=2.1.126>And, in the spiced Indian air, by night,</A>
<A NAME=2.1.127>Full often hath she gossip'd by my side,</A>
<A NAME=2.1.128>And sat with me on Neptune's yellow sands,</A>
<A NAME=2.1.129>Marking the embarked traders on the flood,</A>
<A NAME=2.1.130>When we have laugh'd to see the sails conceive</A>
<A NAME=2.1.131>And grow big-bellied with the wanton wind;</A>
<A NAME=2.1.132>Which she, with pretty and with swimming gait</A>
<A NAME=2.1.133>Following,--her womb then rich with my young squire,--</A>
<A NAME=2.1.134>Would imitate, and sail upon the land,</A>
<A NAME=2.1.135>To fetch me trifles, and return again,</A>
<A NAME=2.1.136>As from a voyage, rich with merchandise.</A>
<A NAME=2.1.137>But she, being mortal, of that boy did die;</A>
<A NAME=2.1.138>And for her sake do I rear up her boy,</A>
<A NAME=2.1.139>And for her sake I will not part with him.</A>
<A NAME=2.1.140>How long within this wood intend you stay?</A>
<A NAME=2.1.141>Perchance till after Theseus' wedding-day.</A>
<A NAME=2.1.142>If you will patiently dance in our round</A>
<A NAME=2.1.143>And see our moonlight revels, go with us;</A>
<A NAME=2.1.144>If not, shun me, and I will spare your haunts.</A>
<A NAME=2.1.145>Give me that boy, and I will go with thee.</A>
<A NAME=2.1.146>Not for thy fairy kingdom. Fairies, away!</A>
<A NAME=2.1.147>We shall chide downright, if I longer stay.</A>
Exit TITANIA with her train
<A NAME=2.1.148>Well, go thy way: thou shalt not from this grove</A>
<A NAME=2.1.149>Till I torment thee for this injury.</A>
<A NAME=2.1.150>My gentle Puck, come hither. Thou rememberest</A>
<A NAME=2.1.151>Since once I sat upon a promontory,</A>
<A NAME=2.1.152>And heard a mermaid on a dolphin's back</A>
<A NAME=2.1.153>Uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath</A>
<A NAME=2.1.154>That the rude sea grew civil at her song</A>
<A NAME=2.1.155>And certain stars shot madly from their spheres,</A>
<A NAME=2.1.156>To hear the sea-maid's music.</A>
<A NAME=2.1.157>I remember.</A>
<A NAME=2.1.158>That very time I saw, but thou couldst not,</A>
<A NAME=2.1.159>Flying between the cold moon and the earth,</A>
<A NAME=2.1.160>Cupid all arm'd: a certain aim he took</A>
<A NAME=2.1.161>At a fair vestal throned by the west,</A>
<A NAME=2.1.162>And loosed his love-shaft smartly from his bow,</A>
<A NAME=2.1.163>As it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts;</A>
<A NAME=2.1.164>But I might see young Cupid's fiery shaft</A>
<A NAME=2.1.165>Quench'd in the chaste beams of the watery moon,</A>
<A NAME=2.1.166>And the imperial votaress passed on,</A>
<A NAME=2.1.167>In maiden meditation, fancy-free.</A>
<A NAME=2.1.168>Yet mark'd I where the bolt of Cupid fell:</A>
<A NAME=2.1.169>It fell upon a little western flower,</A>
<A NAME=2.1.170>Before milk-white, now purple with love's wound,</A>
<A NAME=2.1.171>And maidens call it love-in-idleness.</A>
<A NAME=2.1.172>Fetch me that flower; the herb I shew'd thee once:</A>
<A NAME=2.1.173>The juice of it on sleeping eye-lids laid</A>
<A NAME=2.1.174>Will make or man or woman madly dote</A>
<A NAME=2.1.175>Upon the next live creature that it sees.</A>
<A NAME=2.1.176>Fetch me this herb; and be thou here again</A>
<A NAME=2.1.177>Ere the leviathan can swim a league.</A>
<A NAME=2.1.178>I'll put a girdle round about the earth</A>
<A NAME=2.1.179>In forty minutes.</A>
Exit
<A NAME=2.1.180>                  Having once this juice,</A>
<A NAME=2.1.181>I'll watch Titania when she is asleep,</A>
<A NAME=2.1.182>And drop the liquor of it in her eyes.</A>
<A NAME=2.1.183>The next thing then she waking looks upon,</A>
<A NAME=2.1.184>Be it on lion, bear, or wolf, or bull,</A>
<A NAME=2.1.185>On meddling monkey, or on busy ape,</A>
<A NAME=2.1.186>She shall pursue it with the soul of love:</A>
<A NAME=2.1.187>And ere I take this charm from off her sight,</A>
<A NAME=2.1.188>As I can take it with another herb,</A>
<A NAME=2.1.189>I'll make her render up her page to me.</A>
<A NAME=2.1.190>But who comes here? I am invisible;</A>
<A NAME=2.1.191>And I will overhear their conference.</A>
Enter DEMETRIUS, HELENA, following him
<A NAME=2.1.192>I love thee not, therefore pursue me not.</A>
<A NAME=2.1.193>Where is Lysander and fair Hermia?</A>
<A NAME=2.1.194>The one I'll slay, the other slayeth me.</A>
<A NAME=2.1.195>Thou told'st me they were stolen unto this wood;</A>
<A NAME=2.1.196>And here am I, and wode within this wood,</A>
<A NAME=2.1.197>Because I cannot meet my Hermia.</A>
<A NAME=2.1.198>Hence, get thee gone, and follow me no more.</A>
<A NAME=2.1.199>You draw me, you hard-hearted adamant;</A>
<A NAME=2.1.200>But yet you draw not iron, for my heart</A>
<A NAME=2.1.201>Is true as steel: leave you your power to draw,</A>
<A NAME=2.1.202>And I shall have no power to follow you.</A>
<A NAME=2.1.203>Do I entice you? do I speak you fair?</A>
<A NAME=2.1.204>Or, rather, do I not in plainest truth</A>
<A NAME=2.1.205>Tell you, I do not, nor I cannot love you?</A>
<A NAME=2.1.206>And even for that do I love you the more.</A>
<A NAME=2.1.207>I am your spaniel; and, Demetrius,</A>
<A NAME=2.1.208>The more you beat me, I will fawn on you:</A>
<A NAME=2.1.209>Use me but as your spaniel, spurn me, strike me,</A>
<A NAME=2.1.210>Neglect me, lose me; only give me leave,</A>
<A NAME=2.1.211>Unworthy as I am, to follow you.</A>
<A NAME=2.1.212>What worser place can I beg in your love,--</A>
<A NAME=2.1.213>And yet a place of high respect with me,--</A>
<A NAME=2.1.214>Than to be used as you use your dog?</A>
<A NAME=2.1.215>Tempt not too much the hatred of my spirit;</A>
<A NAME=2.1.216>For I am sick when I do look on thee.</A>
<A NAME=2.1.217>And I am sick when I look not on you.</A>
<A NAME=2.1.218>You do impeach your modesty too much,</A>
<A NAME=2.1.219>To leave the city and commit yourself</A>
<A NAME=2.1.220>Into the hands of one that loves you not;</A>
<A NAME=2.1.221>To trust the opportunity of night</A>
<A NAME=2.1.222>And the ill counsel of a desert place</A>
<A NAME=2.1.223>With the rich worth of your virginity.</A>
<A NAME=2.1.224>Your virtue is my privilege: for that</A>
<A NAME=2.1.225>It is not night when I do see your face,</A>
<A NAME=2.1.226>Therefore I think I am not in the night;</A>
<A NAME=2.1.227>Nor doth this wood lack worlds of company,</A>
<A NAME=2.1.228>For you in my respect are all the world:</A>
<A NAME=2.1.229>Then how can it be said I am alone,</A>
<A NAME=2.1.230>When all the world is here to look on me?</A>
<A NAME=2.1.231>I'll run from thee and hide me in the brakes,</A>
<A NAME=2.1.232>And leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts.</A>
<A NAME=2.1.233>The wildest hath not such a heart as you.</A>
<A NAME=2.1.234>Run when you will, the story shall be changed:</A>
<A NAME=2.1.235>Apollo flies, and Daphne holds the chase;</A>
<A NAME=2.1.236>The dove pursues the griffin; the mild hind</A>
<A NAME=2.1.237>Makes speed to catch the tiger; bootless speed,</A>
<A NAME=2.1.238>When cowardice pursues and valour flies.</A>
<A NAME=2.1.239>I will not stay thy questions; let me go:</A>
<A NAME=2.1.240>Or, if thou follow me, do not believe</A>
<A NAME=2.1.241>But I shall do thee mischief in the wood.</A>
<A NAME=2.1.242>Ay, in the temple, in the town, the field,</A>
<A NAME=2.1.243>You do me mischief. Fie, Demetrius!</A>
<A NAME=2.1.244>Your wrongs do set a scandal on my sex:</A>
<A NAME=2.1.245>We cannot fight for love, as men may do;</A>
<A NAME=2.1.246>We should be wood and were not made to woo.</A>
Exit DEMETRIUS
<A NAME=2.1.247>I'll follow thee and make a heaven of hell,</A>
<A NAME=2.1.248>To die upon the hand I love so well.</A>
Exit
<A NAME=2.1.249>Fare thee well, nymph: ere he do leave this grove,</A>
<A NAME=2.1.250>Thou shalt fly him and he shall seek thy love.</A>
Re-enter PUCK
<A NAME=2.1.251>Hast thou the flower there? Welcome, wanderer.</A>
<A NAME=2.1.252>Ay, there it is.</A>
<A NAME=2.1.253>I pray thee, give it me.</A>
<A NAME=2.1.254>I know a bank where the wild thyme blows,</A>
<A NAME=2.1.255>Where oxlips and the nodding violet grows,</A>
<A NAME=2.1.256>Quite over-canopied with luscious woodbine,</A>
<A NAME=2.1.257>With sweet musk-roses and with eglantine:</A>
<A NAME=2.1.258>There sleeps Titania sometime of the night,</A>
<A NAME=2.1.259>Lull'd in these flowers with dances and delight;</A>
<A NAME=2.1.260>And there the snake throws her enamell'd skin,</A>
<A NAME=2.1.261>Weed wide enough to wrap a fairy in:</A>
<A NAME=2.1.262>And with the juice of this I'll streak her eyes,</A>
<A NAME=2.1.263>And make her full of hateful fantasies.</A>
<A NAME=2.1.264>Take thou some of it, and seek through this grove:</A>
<A NAME=2.1.265>A sweet Athenian lady is in love</A>
<A NAME=2.1.266>With a disdainful youth: anoint his eyes;</A>

<A NAME=2.1.270>Effect it with some care, that he may prove</A>
<A NAME=2.1.271>More fond on her than she upon her love:</A>

Enter LYSANDER and HERMIA
<A NAME=2.2.35>Fair love, you faint with wandering in the wood;</A>
<A NAME=2.2.36>And to speak troth, I have forgot our way:</A>
<A NAME=2.2.37>We'll rest us, Hermia, if you think it good,</A>
<A NAME=2.2.38>And tarry for the comfort of the day.</A>
<A NAME=2.2.39>Be it so, Lysander: find you out a bed;</A>
<A NAME=2.2.40>For I upon this bank will rest my head.</A>
<A NAME=2.2.41>One turf shall serve as pillow for us both;</A>
<A NAME=2.2.42>One heart, one bed, two bosoms and one troth.</A>
<A NAME=2.2.43>Nay, good Lysander; for my sake, my dear,</A>
<A NAME=2.2.44>Lie further off yet, do not lie so near.</A>
<A NAME=2.2.45>O, take the sense, sweet, of my innocence!</A>
<A NAME=2.2.46>Love takes the meaning in love's conference.</A>
<A NAME=2.2.47>I mean, that my heart unto yours is knit</A>
<A NAME=2.2.48>So that but one heart we can make of it;</A>
<A NAME=2.2.49>Two bosoms interchained with an oath;</A>
<A NAME=2.2.50>So then two bosoms and a single troth.</A>
<A NAME=2.2.51>Then by your side no bed-room me deny;</A>
<A NAME=2.2.52>For lying so, Hermia, I do not lie.</A>
<A NAME=2.2.53>Lysander riddles very prettily:</A>
<A NAME=2.2.54>Now much beshrew my manners and my pride,</A>
<A NAME=2.2.55>If Hermia meant to say Lysander lied.</A>
<A NAME=2.2.56>But, gentle friend, for love and courtesy</A>
<A NAME=2.2.57>Lie further off; in human modesty,</A>
<A NAME=2.2.58>Such separation as may well be said</A>
<A NAME=2.2.59>Becomes a virtuous bachelor and a maid,</A>
<A NAME=2.2.60>So far be distant; and, good night, sweet friend:</A>
<A NAME=2.2.61>Thy love ne'er alter till thy sweet life end!</A>
<A NAME=2.2.62>Amen, amen, to that fair prayer, say I;</A>

<A NAME=2.2.88>O, I am out of breath in this fond chase!</A>

<A NAME=2.2.90>Happy is Hermia, wheresoe'er she lies;</A>
<A NAME=2.2.91>For she hath blessed and attractive eyes.</A>
<A NAME=2.2.92>How came her eyes so bright? Not with salt tears:</A>
<A NAME=2.2.93>If so, my eyes are oftener wash'd than hers.</A>
<A NAME=2.2.94>No, no, I am as ugly as a bear;</A>
<A NAME=2.2.95>For beasts that meet me run away for fear:</A>
<A NAME=2.2.96>Therefore no marvel though Demetrius</A>
<A NAME=2.2.97>Do, as a monster fly my presence thus.</A>
<A NAME=2.2.98>What wicked and dissembling glass of mine</A>
<A NAME=2.2.99>Made me compare with Hermia's sphery eyne?</A>
<A NAME=2.2.100>But who is here? Lysander! on the ground!</A>

<A NAME=2.2.106>Where is Demetrius? O, how fit a word</A>
<A NAME=2.2.107>Is that vile name to perish on my sword!</A>
<A NAME=2.2.108>Do not say so, Lysander; say not so</A>
<A NAME=2.2.109>What though he love your Hermia? Lord, what though?</A>
<A NAME=2.2.110>Yet Hermia still loves you: then be content.</A>
<A NAME=2.2.111>Content with Hermia! No; I do repent</A>
<A NAME=2.2.112>The tedious minutes I with her have spent.</A>
<A NAME=2.2.113>Not Hermia but Helena I love:</A>
<A NAME=2.2.114>Who will not change a raven for a dove?</A>
<A NAME=2.2.115>The will of man is by his reason sway'd;</A>
<A NAME=2.2.116>And reason says you are the worthier maid.</A>
<A NAME=2.2.117>Things growing are not ripe until their season</A>

<A NAME=2.2.123>Wherefore was I to this keen mockery born?</A>

<A NAME=2.2.130>In such disdainful manner me to woo.</A>
<A NAME=2.2.131>But fare you well: perforce I must confess</A>
<A NAME=2.2.132>I thought you lord of more true gentleness.</A>

# ACT III
## SCENE The wood. TITANIA lying asleep
<A NAME=3.1.1>Are we all met?</A>
<A NAME=3.1.2>Pat, pat; and here's a marvellous convenient place</A>
<A NAME=3.1.3>for our rehearsal. This green plot shall be our</A>
<A NAME=3.1.4>stage, this hawthorn-brake our tiring-house; and we</A>
<A NAME=3.1.5>will do it in action as we will do it before the duke.</A>
<A NAME=3.1.6>Peter Quince,--</A>
<A NAME=3.1.7>What sayest thou, bully Bottom?</A>
<A NAME=3.1.8>There are things in this comedy of Pyramus and</A>
<A NAME=3.1.9>Thisby that will never please. First, Pyramus must</A>
<A NAME=3.1.10>draw a sword to kill himself; which the ladies</A>
<A NAME=3.1.11>cannot abide. How answer you that?</A>
<A NAME=3.1.12>By'r lakin, a parlous fear.</A>
<A NAME=3.1.13>I believe we must leave the killing out, when all is done.</A>
<A NAME=3.1.14>Not a whit: I have a device to make all well.</A>
<A NAME=3.1.15>Write me a prologue; and let the prologue seem to</A>
<A NAME=3.1.16>say, we will do no harm with our swords, and that</A>
<A NAME=3.1.17>Pyramus is not killed indeed; and, for the more</A>
<A NAME=3.1.18>better assurance, tell them that I, Pyramus, am not</A>
<A NAME=3.1.19>Pyramus, but Bottom the weaver: this will put them</A>
<A NAME=3.1.20>out of fear.</A>
<A NAME=3.1.21>Well, we will have such a prologue; and it shall be</A>
<A NAME=3.1.22>written in eight and six.</A>
<A NAME=3.1.23>No, make it two more; let it be written in eight and eight.</A>
<A NAME=3.1.24>Will not the ladies be afeard of the lion?</A>
<A NAME=3.1.25>I fear it, I promise you.</A>
<A NAME=3.1.26>Masters, you ought to consider with yourselves: to</A>
<A NAME=3.1.27>bring in--God shield us!--a lion among ladies, is a</A>
<A NAME=3.1.28>most dreadful thing; for there is not a more fearful</A>
<A NAME=3.1.29>wild-fowl than your lion living; and we ought to</A>
<A NAME=3.1.30>look to 't.</A>
<A NAME=3.1.31>Therefore another prologue must tell he is not a lion.</A>
<A NAME=3.1.32>Nay, you must name his name, and half his face must</A>
<A NAME=3.1.33>be seen through the lion's neck: and he himself</A>
<A NAME=3.1.34>must speak through, saying thus, or to the same</A>
<A NAME=3.1.35>defect,--'Ladies,'--or 'Fair-ladies--I would wish</A>
<A NAME=3.1.36>You,'--or 'I would request you,'--or 'I would</A>
<A NAME=3.1.37>entreat you,--not to fear, not to tremble: my life</A>
<A NAME=3.1.38>for yours. If you think I come hither as a lion, it</A>
<A NAME=3.1.39>were pity of my life: no I am no such thing; I am a</A>
<A NAME=3.1.40>man as other men are;' and there indeed let him name</A>
<A NAME=3.1.41>his name, and tell them plainly he is Snug the joiner.</A>
<A NAME=3.1.42>Well it shall be so. But there is two hard things;</A>
<A NAME=3.1.43>that is, to bring the moonlight into a chamber; for,</A>
<A NAME=3.1.44>you know, Pyramus and Thisby meet by moonlight.</A>
<A NAME=3.1.45>Doth the moon shine that night we play our play?</A>
<A NAME=3.1.46>A calendar, a calendar! look in the almanac; find</A>
<A NAME=3.1.47>out moonshine, find out moonshine.</A>
<A NAME=3.1.48>Yes, it doth shine that night.</A>
<A NAME=3.1.49>Why, then may you leave a casement of the great</A>
<A NAME=3.1.50>chamber window, where we play, open, and the moon</A>
<A NAME=3.1.51>may shine in at the casement.</A>
<A NAME=3.1.52>Ay; or else one must come in with a bush of thorns</A>
<A NAME=3.1.53>and a lanthorn, and say he comes to disfigure, or to</A>
<A NAME=3.1.54>present, the person of Moonshine. Then, there is</A>
<A NAME=3.1.55>another thing: we must have a wall in the great</A>
<A NAME=3.1.56>chamber; for Pyramus and Thisby says the story, did</A>
<A NAME=3.1.57>talk through the chink of a wall.</A>
<A NAME=3.1.58>You can never bring in a wall. What say you, Bottom?</A>
<A NAME=3.1.59>Some man or other must present Wall: and let him</A>
<A NAME=3.1.60>have some plaster, or some loam, or some rough-cast</A>
<A NAME=3.1.61>about him, to signify wall; and let him hold his</A>
<A NAME=3.1.62>fingers thus, and through that cranny shall Pyramus</A>
<A NAME=3.1.63>and Thisby whisper.</A>
<A NAME=3.1.64>If that may be, then all is well. Come, sit  down,</A>
<A NAME=3.1.65>every mother's son, and rehearse your parts.</A>
<A NAME=3.1.66>Pyramus, you begin: when you have spoken your</A>
<A NAME=3.1.67>speech, enter into that brake: and so every one</A>
<A NAME=3.1.68>according to his cue.</A>
Enter PUCK behind

<A NAME=3.1.72>An actor too, perhaps, if I see cause.</A>
<A NAME=3.1.73>Speak, Pyramus. Thisby, stand forth.</A>
<A NAME=3.1.74>Thisby, the flowers of odious savours sweet,--</A>

<A NAME=3.2.6>What night-rule now about this haunted grove?</A>
<A NAME=3.2.7>My mistress with a monster is in love.</A>
<A NAME=3.2.8>Near to her close and consecrated bower,</A>
<A NAME=3.2.9>While she was in her dull and sleeping hour,</A>
<A NAME=3.2.10>A crew of patches, rude mechanicals,</A>
<A NAME=3.2.11>That work for bread upon Athenian stalls,</A>
<A NAME=3.2.12>Were met together to rehearse a play</A>
<A NAME=3.2.13>Intended for great Theseus' nuptial-day.</A>
<A NAME=3.2.14>The shallowest thick-skin of that barren sort,</A>
<A NAME=3.2.15>Who Pyramus presented, in their sport</A>
<A NAME=3.2.16>Forsook his scene and enter'd in a brake</A>
<A NAME=3.2.17>When I did him at this advantage take,</A>
<A NAME=3.2.18>An ass's nole I fixed on his head:</A>
<A NAME=3.2.19>Anon his Thisbe must be answered,</A>
<A NAME=3.2.20>And forth my mimic comes. When they him spy,</A>
<A NAME=3.2.21>As wild geese that the creeping fowler eye,</A>
<A NAME=3.2.22>Or russet-pated choughs, many in sort,</A>
<A NAME=3.2.23>Rising and cawing at the gun's report,</A>
<A NAME=3.2.24>Sever themselves and madly sweep the sky,</A>
<A NAME=3.2.25>So, at his sight, away his fellows fly;</A>
<A NAME=3.2.26>And, at our stamp, here o'er and o'er one falls;</A>
<A NAME=3.2.27>He murder cries and help from Athens calls.</A>
<A NAME=3.2.28>Their sense thus weak, lost with their fears</A>
<A NAME=3.2.29>thus strong,</A>
<A NAME=3.2.30>Made senseless things begin to do them wrong;</A>
<A NAME=3.2.31>For briers and thorns at their apparel snatch;</A>
<A NAME=3.2.32>Some sleeves, some hats, from yielders all</A>
<A NAME=3.2.33>things catch.</A>
<A NAME=3.2.34>I led them on in this distracted fear,</A>
<A NAME=3.2.35>And left sweet Pyramus translated there:</A>
<A NAME=3.2.36>When in that moment, so it came to pass,</A>
<A NAME=3.2.37>Titania waked and straightway loved an ass.</A>
<A NAME=3.2.38>This falls out better than I could devise.</A>
<A NAME=3.2.39>But hast thou yet latch'd the Athenian's eyes</A>
<A NAME=3.2.40>With the love-juice, as I did bid thee do?</A>
<A NAME=3.2.41>I took him sleeping,--that is finish'd too,--</A>

Enter HERMIA and DEMETRIUS
<A NAME=3.2.44>Stand close: this is the same Athenian.</A>

<A NAME=3.2.46>O, why rebuke you him that loves you so?</A>
<A NAME=3.2.47>Lay breath so bitter on your bitter foe.</A>
<A NAME=3.2.48>Now I but chide; but I should use thee worse,</A>
<A NAME=3.2.49>For thou, I fear, hast given me cause to curse,</A>
<A NAME=3.2.50>If thou hast slain Lysander in his sleep,</A>
<A NAME=3.2.51>Being o'er shoes in blood, plunge in the deep,</A>
<A NAME=3.2.52>And kill me too.</A>
<A NAME=3.2.53>The sun was not so true unto the day</A>

<A NAME=3.2.56>This whole earth may be bored and that the moon</A>
<A NAME=3.2.57>May through the centre creep and so displease</A>
<A NAME=3.2.58>Her brother's noontide with Antipodes.</A>
<A NAME=3.2.59>It cannot be but thou hast murder'd him;</A>
<A NAME=3.2.60>So should a murderer look, so dead, so grim.</A>
<A NAME=3.2.61>So should the murder'd look, and so should I,</A>
<A NAME=3.2.62>Pierced through the heart with your stern cruelty:</A>
<A NAME=3.2.63>Yet you, the murderer, look as bright, as clear,</A>
<A NAME=3.2.64>As yonder Venus in her glimmering sphere.</A>
<A NAME=3.2.65>What's this to my Lysander? where is he?</A>
<A NAME=3.2.66>Ah, good Demetrius, wilt thou give him me?</A>
<A NAME=3.2.67>I had rather give his carcass to my hounds.</A>
<A NAME=3.2.68>Out, dog! out, cur! thou drivest me past the bounds</A>
<A NAME=3.2.69>Of maiden's patience. Hast thou slain him, then?</A>

<A NAME=3.2.71>O, once tell true, tell true, even for my sake!</A>
<A NAME=3.2.72>Durst thou have look'd upon him being awake,</A>
<A NAME=3.2.73>And hast thou kill'd him sleeping? O brave touch!</A>
<A NAME=3.2.74>Could not a worm, an adder, do so much?</A>
<A NAME=3.2.75>An adder did it; for with doubler tongue</A>
<A NAME=3.2.76>Than thine, thou serpent, never adder stung.</A>
<A NAME=3.2.77>You spend your passion on a misprised mood:</A>
<A NAME=3.2.78>I am not guilty of Lysander's blood;</A>
<A NAME=3.2.79>Nor is he dead, for aught that I can tell.</A>
<A NAME=3.2.80>I pray thee, tell me then that he is well.</A>
<A NAME=3.2.81>An if I could, what should I get therefore?</A>
<A NAME=3.2.82>A privilege never to see me more.</A>
<A NAME=3.2.83>And from thy hated presence part I so:</A>
<A NAME=3.2.84>See me no more, whether he be dead or no.</A>
Exit
<A NAME=3.2.85>There is no following her in this fierce vein:</A>
<A NAME=3.2.86>Here therefore for a while I will remain.</A>
<A NAME=3.2.87>So sorrow's heaviness doth heavier grow</A>
<A NAME=3.2.88>For debt that bankrupt sleep doth sorrow owe:</A>

Lies down and sleeps
<A NAME=3.2.91>What hast thou done? thou hast mistaken quite</A>
<A NAME=3.2.92>And laid the love-juice on some true-love's sight:</A>

<A NAME=3.2.94>Some true love turn'd and not a false turn'd true.</A>

<A NAME=3.2.131>You do advance your cunning more and more.</A>
<A NAME=3.2.132>When truth kills truth, O devilish-holy fray!</A>
<A NAME=3.2.133>These vows are Hermia's: will you give her o'er?</A>

<A NAME=3.2.135>Your vows to her and me, put in two scales,</A>
<A NAME=3.2.136>Will even weigh, and both as light as tales.</A>
<A NAME=3.2.137>I had no judgment when to her I swore.</A>

<A NAME=3.2.162>With your derision! none of noble sort</A>

<A NAME=3.2.257>I swear by that which I will lose for thee,</A>
<A NAME=3.2.258>To prove him false that says I love thee not.</A>
<A NAME=3.2.259>I say I love thee more than he can do.</A>
<A NAME=3.2.260>If thou say so, withdraw, and prove it too.</A>

<A NAME=3.2.262>Lysander, whereto tends all this?</A>

<A NAME=3.2.265>Seem to break loose; take on as you would follow,</A>

<A NAME=3.2.267>Hang off, thou cat, thou burr! vile thing, let loose,</A>
<A NAME=3.2.268>Or I will shake thee from me like a serpent!</A>
<A NAME=3.2.269>Why are you grown so rude? what change is this?</A>
<A NAME=3.2.270>Sweet love,--</A>
<A NAME=3.2.271>Thy love! out, tawny Tartar, out!</A>

<A NAME=3.2.273>Do you not jest?</A>
<A NAME=3.2.274>Yes, sooth; and so do you.</A>
<A NAME=3.2.275>Demetrius, I will keep my word with thee.</A>
<A NAME=3.2.276>I would I had your bond, for I perceive</A>
<A NAME=3.2.277>A weak bond holds you: I'll not trust your word.</A>
<A NAME=3.2.278>What, should I hurt her, strike her, kill her dead?</A>
<A NAME=3.2.279>Although I hate her, I'll not harm her so.</A>
<A NAME=3.2.280>What, can you do me greater harm than hate?</A>
<A NAME=3.2.281>Hate me! wherefore? O me! what news, my love!</A>
<A NAME=3.2.282>Am not I Hermia? are not you Lysander?</A>
<A NAME=3.2.283>I am as fair now as I was erewhile.</A>
<A NAME=3.2.284>Since night you loved me; yet since night you left</A>

<A NAME=3.2.286>Why, then you left me--O, the gods forbid!--</A>
<A NAME=3.2.287>In earnest, shall I say?</A>
<A NAME=3.2.288>Ay, by my life;</A>
<A NAME=3.2.289>And never did desire to see thee more.</A>

<A NAME=3.2.291>Be certain, nothing truer; 'tis no jest</A>

<A NAME=3.2.293>O me! you juggler! you canker-blossom!</A>
<A NAME=3.2.294>You thief of love! what, have you come by night</A>
<A NAME=3.2.295>And stolen my love's heart from him?</A>
<A NAME=3.2.296>Fine, i'faith!</A>
<A NAME=3.2.297>Have you no modesty, no maiden shame,</A>
<A NAME=3.2.298>No touch of bashfulness? What, will you tear</A>
<A NAME=3.2.299>Impatient answers from my gentle tongue?</A>
<A NAME=3.2.300>Fie, fie! you counterfeit, you puppet, you!</A>
<A NAME=3.2.301>Puppet? why so? ay, that way goes the game.</A>
<A NAME=3.2.302>Now I perceive that she hath made compare</A>
<A NAME=3.2.303>Between our statures; she hath urged her height;</A>
<A NAME=3.2.304>And with her personage, her tall personage,</A>
<A NAME=3.2.305>Her height, forsooth, she hath prevail'd with him.</A>
<A NAME=3.2.306>And are you grown so high in his esteem;</A>
<A NAME=3.2.307>Because I am so dwarfish and so low?</A>
<A NAME=3.2.308>How low am I, thou painted maypole? speak;</A>
<A NAME=3.2.309>How low am I? I am not yet so low</A>
<A NAME=3.2.310>But that my nails can reach unto thine eyes.</A>
<A NAME=3.2.311>I pray you, though you mock me, gentlemen,</A>
<A NAME=3.2.312>Let her not hurt me: I was never curst;</A>
<A NAME=3.2.313>I have no gift at all in shrewishness;</A>
<A NAME=3.2.314>I am a right maid for my cowardice:</A>
<A NAME=3.2.315>Let her not strike me. You perhaps may think,</A>
<A NAME=3.2.316>Because she is something lower than myself,</A>
<A NAME=3.2.317>That I can match her.</A>
<A NAME=3.2.318>Lower! hark, again.</A>
<A NAME=3.2.319>Good Hermia, do not be so bitter with me.</A>
<A NAME=3.2.320>I evermore did love you, Hermia,</A>
<A NAME=3.2.321>Did ever keep your counsels, never wrong'd you;</A>
<A NAME=3.2.322>Save that, in love unto Demetrius,</A>
<A NAME=3.2.323>I told him of your stealth unto this wood.</A>
<A NAME=3.2.324>He follow'd you; for love I follow'd him;</A>
<A NAME=3.2.325>But he hath chid me hence and threaten'd me</A>
<A NAME=3.2.326>To strike me, spurn me, nay, to kill me too:</A>
<A NAME=3.2.327>And now, so you will let me quiet go,</A>
<A NAME=3.2.328>To Athens will I bear my folly back</A>
<A NAME=3.2.329>And follow you no further: let me go:</A>
<A NAME=3.2.330>You see how simple and how fond I am.</A>
<A NAME=3.2.331>Why, get you gone: who is't that hinders you?</A>
<A NAME=3.2.332>A foolish heart, that I leave here behind.</A>
<A NAME=3.2.333>What, with Lysander?</A>
<A NAME=3.2.334>With Demetrius.</A>
<A NAME=3.2.335>Be not afraid; she shall not harm thee, Helena.</A>
<A NAME=3.2.336>No, sir, she shall not, though you take her part.</A>
<A NAME=3.2.337>O, when she's angry, she is keen and shrewd!</A>
<A NAME=3.2.338>She was a vixen when she went to school;</A>
<A NAME=3.2.339>And though she be but little, she is fierce.</A>
<A NAME=3.2.340>'Little' again! nothing but 'low' and 'little'!</A>
<A NAME=3.2.341>Why will you suffer her to flout me thus?</A>
<A NAME=3.2.342>Let me come to her.</A>
<A NAME=3.2.343>Get you gone, you dwarf;</A>
<A NAME=3.2.344>You minimus, of hindering knot-grass made;</A>
<A NAME=3.2.345>You bead, you acorn.</A>
<A NAME=3.2.346>You are too officious</A>
<A NAME=3.2.347>In her behalf that scorns your services.</A>
<A NAME=3.2.348>Let her alone: speak not of Helena;</A>
<A NAME=3.2.349>Take not her part; for, if thou dost intend</A>
<A NAME=3.2.350>Never so little show of love to her,</A>
<A NAME=3.2.351>Thou shalt aby it.</A>
<A NAME=3.2.352>                  Now she holds me not;</A>
<A NAME=3.2.353>Now follow, if thou darest, to try whose right,</A>
<A NAME=3.2.354>Of thine or mine, is most in Helena.</A>
<A NAME=3.2.355>Follow! nay, I'll go with thee, cheek by jole.</A>

<A NAME=5.1.119>Our true intent is. All for your delight</A>
<A NAME=5.1.120>We are not here. That you should here repent you,</A>
<A NAME=5.1.121>The actors are at hand and by their show</A>
<A NAME=5.1.122>You shall know all that you are like to know.</A>
<A NAME=5.1.123>This fellow doth not stand upon points.</A>
<A NAME=5.1.124>He hath rid his prologue like a rough colt; he knows</A>
<A NAME=5.1.125>not the stop. A good moral, my lord: it is not</A>
<A NAME=5.1.126>enough to speak, but to speak true.</A>
<A NAME=5.1.127>Indeed he hath played on his prologue like a child</A>
<A NAME=5.1.128>on a recorder; a sound, but not in government.</A>
<A NAME=5.1.129>His speech, was like a tangled chain; nothing</A>
<A NAME=5.1.130>impaired, but all disordered. Who is next?</A>
Enter Pyramus and Thisbe, Wall, Moonshine, and Lion
<A NAME=5.1.131>Gentles, perchance you wonder at this show;</A>
<A NAME=5.1.132>But wonder on, till truth make all things plain.</A>
<A NAME=5.1.133>This man is Pyramus, if you would know;</A>
<A NAME=5.1.134>This beauteous lady Thisby is certain.</A>
<A NAME=5.1.135>This man, with lime and rough-cast, doth present</A>
<A NAME=5.1.136>Wall, that vile Wall which did these lovers sunder;</A>
<A NAME=5.1.137>And through Wall's chink, poor souls, they are content</A>
<A NAME=5.1.138>To whisper. At the which let no man wonder.</A>
<A NAME=5.1.139>This man, with lanthorn, dog, and bush of thorn,</A>
<A NAME=5.1.140>Presenteth Moonshine; for, if you will know,</A>
<A NAME=5.1.141>By moonshine did these lovers think no scorn</A>
<A NAME=5.1.142>To meet at Ninus' tomb, there, there to woo.</A>
<A NAME=5.1.143>This grisly beast, which Lion hight by name,</A>
<A NAME=5.1.144>The trusty Thisby, coming first by night,</A>
<A NAME=5.1.145>Did scare away, or rather did affright;</A>
<A NAME=5.1.146>And, as she fled, her mantle she did fall,</A>
<A NAME=5.1.147>Which Lion vile with bloody mouth did stain.</A>
<A NAME=5.1.148>Anon comes Pyramus, sweet youth and tall,</A>
<A NAME=5.1.149>And finds his trusty Thisby's mantle slain:</A>
<A NAME=5.1.150>Whereat, with blade, with bloody blameful blade,</A>
<A NAME=5.1.151>He bravely broach'd is boiling bloody breast;</A>
<A NAME=5.1.152>And Thisby, tarrying in mulberry shade,</A>
<A NAME=5.1.153>His dagger drew, and died. For all the rest,</A>
<A NAME=5.1.154>Let Lion, Moonshine, Wall, and lovers twain</A>
<A NAME=5.1.155>At large discourse, while here they do remain.</A>
Exeunt Prologue, Thisbe, Lion, and Moonshine
<A NAME=5.1.156>I wonder if the lion be to speak.</A>
<A NAME=5.1.157>No wonder, my lord: one lion may, when many asses do.</A>
<A NAME=5.1.158>In this same interlude it doth befall</A>
<A NAME=5.1.159>That I, one Snout by name, present a wall;</A>
<A NAME=5.1.160>And such a wall, as I would have you think,</A>
<A NAME=5.1.161>That had in it a crannied hole or chink,</A>
<A NAME=5.1.162>Through which the lovers, Pyramus and Thisby,</A>
<A NAME=5.1.163>Did whisper often very secretly.</A>
<A NAME=5.1.164>This loam, this rough-cast and this stone doth show</A>
<A NAME=5.1.165>That I am that same wall; the truth is so:</A>
<A NAME=5.1.166>And this the cranny is, right and sinister,</A>
<A NAME=5.1.167>Through which the fearful lovers are to whisper.</A>
<A NAME=5.1.168>Would you desire lime and hair to speak better?</A>
<A NAME=5.1.169>It is the wittiest partition that ever I heard</A>
<A NAME=5.1.170>discourse, my lord.</A>
Enter Pyramus
<A NAME=5.1.171>Pyramus draws near the wall: silence!</A>
<A NAME=5.1.172>O grim-look'd night! O night with hue so black!</A>
<A NAME=5.1.173>O night, which ever art when day is not!</A>
<A NAME=5.1.174>O night, O night! alack, alack, alack,</A>
<A NAME=5.1.175>I fear my Thisby's promise is forgot!</A>
<A NAME=5.1.176>And thou, O wall, O sweet, O lovely wall,</A>
<A NAME=5.1.177>That stand'st between her father's ground and mine!</A>
<A NAME=5.1.178>Thou wall, O wall, O sweet and lovely wall,</A>
<A NAME=5.1.179>Show me thy chink, to blink through with mine eyne!</A>
Wall holds up his fingers
<A NAME=5.1.180>Thanks, courteous wall: Jove shield thee well for this!</A>
<A NAME=5.1.181>But what see I? No Thisby do I see.</A>
<A NAME=5.1.182>O wicked wall, through whom I see no bliss!</A>
<A NAME=5.1.183>Cursed be thy stones for thus deceiving me!</A>
<A NAME=5.1.184>The wall, methinks, being sensible, should curse again.</A>
<A NAME=5.1.185>No, in truth, sir, he should not. 'Deceiving me'</A>
<A NAME=5.1.186>is Thisby's cue: she is to enter now, and I am to</A>
<A NAME=5.1.187>spy her through the wall. You shall see, it will</A>
<A NAME=5.1.188>fall pat as I told you. Yonder she comes.</A>
Enter Thisbe
<A NAME=5.1.189>O wall, full often hast thou heard my moans,</A>
<A NAME=5.1.190>For parting my fair Pyramus and me!</A>
<A NAME=5.1.191>My cherry lips have often kiss'd thy stones,</A>
<A NAME=5.1.192>Thy stones with lime and hair knit up in thee.</A>
<A NAME=5.1.193>I see a voice: now will I to the chink,</A>
<A NAME=5.1.194>To spy an I can hear my Thisby's face. Thisby!</A>
<A NAME=5.1.195>My love thou art, my love I think.</A>
<A NAME=5.1.196>Think what thou wilt, I am thy lover's grace;</A>
<A NAME=5.1.197>And, like Limander, am I trusty still.</A>
<A NAME=5.1.198>And I like Helen, till the Fates me kill.</A>
<A NAME=5.1.199>Not Shafalus to Procrus was so true.</A>
<A NAME=5.1.200>As Shafalus to Procrus, I to you.</A>
<A NAME=5.1.201>O kiss me through the hole of this vile wall!</A>
<A NAME=5.1.202>I kiss the wall's hole, not your lips at all.</A>
<A NAME=5.1.203>Wilt thou at Ninny's tomb meet me straightway?</A>
<A NAME=5.1.204>'Tide life, 'tide death, I come without delay.</A>
Exeunt Pyramus and Thisbe
<A NAME=5.1.205>Thus have I, Wall, my part discharged so;</A>
<A NAME=5.1.206>And, being done, thus Wall away doth go.</A>
Exit
<A NAME=5.1.207>Now is the mural down between the two neighbours.</A>
<A NAME=5.1.208>No remedy, my lord, when walls are so wilful to hear</A>
<A NAME=5.1.209>without warning.</A>
<A NAME=5.1.210>This is the silliest stuff that ever I heard.</A>
<A NAME=5.1.211>The best in this kind are but shadows; and the worst</A>
<A NAME=5.1.212>are no worse, if imagination amend them.</A>
<A NAME=5.1.213>It must be your imagination then, and not theirs.</A>
<A NAME=5.1.214>If we imagine no worse of them than they of</A>
<A NAME=5.1.215>themselves, they may pass for excellent men. Here</A>
<A NAME=5.1.216>come two noble beasts in, a man and a lion.</A>
Enter Lion and Moonshine
<A NAME=5.1.217>You, ladies, you, whose gentle hearts do fear</A>
<A NAME=5.1.218>The smallest monstrous mouse that creeps on floor,</A>
<A NAME=5.1.219>May now perchance both quake and tremble here,</A>
<A NAME=5.1.220>When lion rough in wildest rage doth roar.</A>
<A NAME=5.1.221>Then know that I, one Snug the joiner, am</A>
<A NAME=5.1.222>A lion-fell, nor else no lion's dam;</A>
<A NAME=5.1.223>For, if I should as lion come in strife</A>
<A NAME=5.1.224>Into this place, 'twere pity on my life.</A>
<A NAME=5.1.225>A very gentle beast, of a good conscience.</A>
<A NAME=5.1.226>The very best at a beast, my lord, that e'er I saw.</A>
<A NAME=5.1.227>This lion is a very fox for his valour.</A>
<A NAME=5.1.228>True; and a goose for his discretion.</A>
<A NAME=5.1.229>Not so, my lord; for his valour cannot carry his</A>
<A NAME=5.1.230>discretion; and the fox carries the goose.</A>
<A NAME=5.1.231>His discretion, I am sure, cannot carry his valour;</A>
<A NAME=5.1.232>for the goose carries not the fox. It is well:</A>
<A NAME=5.1.233>leave it to his discretion, and let us listen to the moon.</A>
<A NAME=5.1.234>This lanthorn doth the horned moon present;--</A>
<A NAME=5.1.235>He should have worn the horns on his head.</A>
<A NAME=5.1.236>He is no crescent, and his horns are</A>
<A NAME=5.1.237>invisible within the circumference.</A>
<A NAME=5.1.238>This lanthorn doth the horned moon present;</A>
<A NAME=5.1.239>Myself the man i' the moon do seem to be.</A>
<A NAME=5.1.240>This is the greatest error of all the rest: the man</A>
<A NAME=5.1.241>should be put into the lanthorn. How is it else the</A>
<A NAME=5.1.242>man i' the moon?</A>
<A NAME=5.1.243>He dares not come there for the candle; for, you</A>
<A NAME=5.1.244>see, it is already in snuff.</A>
<A NAME=5.1.245>I am aweary of this moon: would he would change!</A>
<A NAME=5.1.246>It appears, by his small light of discretion, that</A>
<A NAME=5.1.247>he is in the wane; but yet, in courtesy, in all</A>
<A NAME=5.1.248>reason, we must stay the time.</A>
<A NAME=5.1.249>Proceed, Moon.</A>
<A NAME=5.1.250>All that I have to say, is, to tell you that the</A>
<A NAME=5.1.251>lanthorn is the moon; I, the man in the moon; this</A>
<A NAME=5.1.252>thorn-bush, my thorn-bush; and this dog, my dog.</A>
<A NAME=5.1.253>Why, all these should be in the lanthorn; for all</A>
<A NAME=5.1.254>these are in the moon. But, silence! here comes Thisbe.</A>
Enter Thisbe
<A NAME=5.1.255>This is old Ninny's tomb. Where is my love?</A>
<A NAME=5.1.256>[Roaring]  Oh--</A>
Thisbe runs off
<A NAME=5.1.257>Well roared, Lion.</A>
<A NAME=5.1.258>Well run, Thisbe.</A>
<A NAME=5.1.259>Well shone, Moon. Truly, the moon shines with a</A>
<A NAME=5.1.260>good grace.</A>
The Lion shakes Thisbe's mantle, and exit
<A NAME=5.1.261>Well moused, Lion.</A>
<A NAME=5.1.262>And so the lion vanished.</A>
<A NAME=5.1.263>And then came Pyramus.</A>
Enter Pyramus
<A NAME=5.1.264>Sweet Moon, I thank thee for thy sunny beams;</A>
<A NAME=5.1.265>I thank thee, Moon, for shining now so bright;</A>
<A NAME=5.1.266>For, by thy gracious, golden, glittering gleams,</A>
<A NAME=5.1.267>I trust to take of truest Thisby sight.</A>
<A NAME=5.1.268>But stay, O spite!</A>
<A NAME=5.1.269>But mark, poor knight,</A>
<A NAME=5.1.270>What dreadful dole is here!</A>
<A NAME=5.1.271>Eyes, do you see?</A>
<A NAME=5.1.272>How can it be?</A>
<A NAME=5.1.273>O dainty duck! O dear!</A>
<A NAME=5.1.274>Thy mantle good,</A>
<A NAME=5.1.275>What, stain'd with blood!</A>
<A NAME=5.1.276>Approach, ye Furies fell!</A>
<A NAME=5.1.277>O Fates, come, come,</A>
<A NAME=5.1.278>Cut thread and thrum;</A>
<A NAME=5.1.279>Quail, crush, conclude, and quell!</A>
<A NAME=5.1.280>This passion, and the death of a dear friend, would</A>
<A NAME=5.1.281>go near to make a man look sad.</A>
<A NAME=5.1.282>Beshrew my heart, but I pity the man.</A>
<A NAME=5.1.283>O wherefore, Nature, didst thou lions frame?</A>
<A NAME=5.1.284>Since lion vile hath here deflower'd my dear:</A>
<A NAME=5.1.285>Which is--no, no--which was the fairest dame</A>
<A NAME=5.1.286>That lived, that loved, that liked, that look'd</A>
<A NAME=5.1.287>with cheer.</A>
<A NAME=5.1.288>Come, tears, confound;</A>
<A NAME=5.1.289>Out, sword, and wound</A>
<A NAME=5.1.290>The pap of Pyramus;</A>
<A NAME=5.1.291>Ay, that left pap,</A>
<A NAME=5.1.292>Where heart doth hop:</A>
Stabs himself
<A NAME=5.1.293>Thus die I, thus, thus, thus.</A>
<A NAME=5.1.294>Now am I dead,</A>
<A NAME=5.1.295>Now am I fled;</A>
<A NAME=5.1.296>My soul is in the sky:</A>
<A NAME=5.1.297>Tongue, lose thy light;</A>
<A NAME=5.1.298>Moon take thy flight:</A>
Exit Moonshine
<A NAME=5.1.299>Now die, die, die, die, die.</A>
Dies
<A NAME=5.1.300>No die, but an ace, for him; for he is but one.</A>
<A NAME=5.1.301>Less than an ace, man; for he is dead; he is nothing.</A>
<A NAME=5.1.302>With the help of a surgeon he might yet recover, and</A>
<A NAME=5.1.303>prove an ass.</A>
<A NAME=5.1.304>How chance Moonshine is gone before Thisbe comes</A>
<A NAME=5.1.305>back and finds her lover?</A>
<A NAME=5.1.306>She will find him by starlight. Here she comes; and</A>
<A NAME=5.1.307>her passion ends the play.</A>
Re-enter Thisbe
<A NAME=5.1.308>Methinks she should not use a long one for such a</A>
<A NAME=5.1.309>Pyramus: I hope she will be brief.</A>
<A NAME=5.1.310>A mote will turn the balance, which Pyramus, which</A>
<A NAME=5.1.311>Thisbe, is the better; he for a man, God warrant us;</A>
<A NAME=5.1.312>she for a woman, God bless us.</A>
<A NAME=5.1.313>She hath spied him already with those sweet eyes.</A>
<A NAME=5.1.314>And thus she means, videlicet:--</A>
<A NAME=5.1.315>          Asleep, my love?</A>
<A NAME=5.1.316>What, dead, my dove?</A>
<A NAME=5.1.317>O Pyramus, arise!</A>
<A NAME=5.1.318>Speak, speak. Quite dumb?</A>
<A NAME=5.1.319>Dead, dead? A tomb</A>
<A NAME=5.1.320>Must cover thy sweet eyes.</A>
<A NAME=5.1.321>These My lips,</A>
<A NAME=5.1.322>This cherry nose,</A>
<A NAME=5.1.323>These yellow cowslip cheeks,</A>
<A NAME=5.1.324>Are gone, are gone:</A>
<A NAME=5.1.325>Lovers, make moan:</A>
<A NAME=5.1.326>His eyes were green as leeks.</A>
<A NAME=5.1.327>O Sisters Three,</A>
<A NAME=5.1.328>Come, come to me,</A>
<A NAME=5.1.329>With hands as pale as milk;</A>
<A NAME=5.1.330>Lay them in gore,</A>
<A NAME=5.1.331>Since you have shore</A>
<A NAME=5.1.332>With shears his thread of silk.</A>
<A NAME=5.1.333>Tongue, not a word:</A>
<A NAME=5.1.334>Come, trusty sword;</A>
<A NAME=5.1.335>Come, blade, my breast imbrue:</A>
Stabs herself
<A NAME=5.1.336>And, farewell, friends;</A>
<A NAME=5.1.337>Thus Thisby ends:</A>
<A NAME=5.1.338>Adieu, adieu, adieu.</A>
Dies
<A NAME=5.1.339>Moonshine and Lion are left to bury the dead.</A>
<A NAME=5.1.340>Ay, and Wall too.</A>
<A NAME=5.1.341>[Starting up]  No assure you; the wall is down that</A>
<A NAME=5.1.342>parted their fathers. Will it please you to see the</A>
<A NAME=5.1.343>epilogue, or to hear a Bergomask dance between two</A>
<A NAME=5.1.344>of our company?</A>
<A NAME=5.1.345>No epilogue, I pray you; for your play needs no</A>
<A NAME=5.1.346>excuse. Never excuse; for when the players are all</A>
<A NAME=5.1.347>dead, there needs none to be blamed. Marry, if he</A>
<A NAME=5.1.348>that writ it had played Pyramus and hanged himself</A>
<A NAME=5.1.349>in Thisbe's garter, it would have been a fine</A>
<A NAME=5.1.350>tragedy: and so it is, truly; and very notably</A>
<A NAME=5.1.351>discharged. But come, your Bergomask: let your</A>
<A NAME=5.1.352>epilogue alone.</A>
A dance
<A NAME=5.1.353>The iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve:</A>
<A NAME=5.1.354>Lovers, to bed; 'tis almost fairy time.</A>
<A NAME=5.1.355>I fear we shall out-sleep the coming morn</A>
<A NAME=5.1.356>As much as we this night have overwatch'd.</A>
<A NAME=5.1.357>This palpable-gross play hath well beguiled</A>
<A NAME=5.1.358>The heavy gait of night. Sweet friends, to bed.</A>
<A NAME=5.1.359>A fortnight hold we this solemnity,</A>
<A NAME=5.1.360>In nightly revels and new jollity.</A>
Exeunt
Enter PUCK
<A NAME=5.1.361>     Now the hungry lion roars,</A>
<A NAME=5.1.362>And the wolf behowls the moon;</A>
<A NAME=5.1.363>Whilst the heavy ploughman snores,</A>
<A NAME=5.1.364>All with weary task fordone.</A>
<A NAME=5.1.365>Now the wasted brands do glow,</A>
<A NAME=5.1.366>Whilst the screech-owl, screeching loud,</A>
<A NAME=5.1.367>Puts the wretch that lies in woe</A>
<A NAME=5.1.368>In remembrance of a shroud.</A>
<A NAME=5.1.369>Now it is the time of night</A>
<A NAME=5.1.370>That the graves all gaping wide,</A>
<A NAME=5.1.371>Every one lets forth his sprite,</A>
<A NAME=5.1.372>In the church-way paths to glide:</A>
<A NAME=5.1.373>And we fairies, that do run</A>
<A NAME=5.1.374>By the triple Hecate's team,</A>
<A NAME=5.1.375>From the presence of the sun,</A>
<A NAME=5.1.376>Following darkness like a dream,</A>
<A NAME=5.1.377>Now are frolic: not a mouse</A>
<A NAME=5.1.378>Shall disturb this hallow'd house:</A>
<A NAME=5.1.379>I am sent with broom before,</A>
<A NAME=5.1.380>To sweep the dust behind the door.</A>
Enter OBERON and TITANIA with their train
<A NAME=5.1.381>     Through the house give gathering light,</A>
<A NAME=5.1.382>By the dead and drowsy fire:</A>
<A NAME=5.1.383>Every elf and fairy sprite</A>
<A NAME=5.1.384>Hop as light as bird from brier;</A>
<A NAME=5.1.385>And this ditty, after me,</A>
<A NAME=5.1.386>Sing, and dance it trippingly.</A>
<A NAME=5.1.387>First, rehearse your song by rote</A>
<A NAME=5.1.388>To each word a warbling note:</A>
<A NAME=5.1.389>Hand in hand, with fairy grace,</A>
<A NAME=5.1.390>Will we sing, and bless this place.</A>
Song and dance
<A NAME=5.1.391>Now, until the break of day,</A>
<A NAME=5.1.392>Through this house each fairy stray.</A>
<A NAME=5.1.393>To the best bride-bed will we,</A>
<A NAME=5.1.394>Which by us shall blessed be;</A>
<A NAME=5.1.395>And the issue there create</A>
<A NAME=5.1.396>Ever shall be fortunate.</A>
<A NAME=5.1.397>So shall all the couples three</A>
<A NAME=5.1.398>Ever true in loving be;</A>
<A NAME=5.1.399>And the blots of Nature's hand</A>
<A NAME=5.1.400>Shall not in their issue stand;</A>
<A NAME=5.1.401>Never mole, hare lip, nor scar,</A>
<A NAME=5.1.402>Nor mark prodigious, such as are</A>
<A NAME=5.1.403>Despised in nativity,</A>
<A NAME=5.1.404>Shall upon their children be.</A>
<A NAME=5.1.405>With this field-dew consecrate,</A>
<A NAME=5.1.406>Every fairy take his gait;</A>
<A NAME=5.1.407>And each several chamber bless,</A>
<A NAME=5.1.408>Through this palace, with sweet peace;</A>
<A NAME=5.1.409>And the owner of it blest</A>
<A NAME=5.1.410>Ever shall in safety rest.</A>
<A NAME=5.1.411>Trip away; make no stay;</A>
<A NAME=5.1.412>Meet me all by break of day.</A>
Exeunt OBERON, TITANIA, and train
<A NAME=5.1.413>If we shadows have offended,</A>
<A NAME=5.1.414>Think but this, and all is mended,</A>
<A NAME=5.1.415>That you have but slumber'd here</A>
<A NAME=5.1.416>While these visions did appear.</A>
<A NAME=5.1.417>And this weak and idle theme,</A>
<A NAME=5.1.418>No more yielding but a dream,</A>
<A NAME=5.1.419>Gentles, do not reprehend:</A>
<A NAME=5.1.420>if you pardon, we will mend:</A>
<A NAME=5.1.421>And, as I am an honest Puck,</A>
<A NAME=5.1.422>If we have unearned luck</A>
<A NAME=5.1.423>Now to 'scape the serpent's tongue,</A>
<A NAME=5.1.424>We will make amends ere long;</A>
<A NAME=5.1.425>Else the Puck a liar call;</A>
<A NAME=5.1.426>So, good night unto you all.</A>
<A NAME=5.1.427>Give me your hands, if we be friends,</A>
<A NAME=5.1.428>And Robin shall restore amends.</A>
